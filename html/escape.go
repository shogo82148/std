// EscapeString escapes special characters like "<" to become "&lt;". It
// escapes only five such characters: <, >, &, ' and ".
// [UnescapeString](EscapeString(s)) == s always holds, but the converse isn't
// always true.
func EscapeString(s string) string

// UnescapeString unescapes entities like "&lt;" to become "<". It unescapes a
// larger range of entities than [EscapeString] escapes. For example, "&aacute;"
// unescapes to "รก", as does "&#225;" and "&#xE1;".
// UnescapeString([EscapeString](s)) == s always holds, but the converse isn't
// always true.
