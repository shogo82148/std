// Seq is an iterator over sequences of individual values.
// When called as seq(yield), seq calls yield(v) for each value v in the sequence,
// stopping early if yield returns false.
type Seq[V any] func(yield func(V) bool)

// Seq2 is an iterator over sequences of pairs of values, most commonly key-value pairs.
// When called as seq(yield), seq calls yield(k, v) for each pair (k, v) in the sequence,
// stopping early if yield returns false.

// Pull converts the “push-style” iterator sequence seq
// into a “pull-style” iterator accessed by the two functions
// next and stop.
//
// Next returns the next value in the sequence
// and a boolean indicating whether the value is valid.
// When the sequence is over, next returns the zero V and false.
// It is valid to call next after reaching the end of the sequence
// or after calling stop. These calls will continue
// to return the zero V and false.
//
// Stop ends the iteration. It must be called when the caller is
// no longer interested in next values and next has not yet
// signaled that the sequence is over (with a false boolean return).
// It is valid to call stop multiple times and when next has
// already returned false.
//
// It is an error to call next or stop from multiple goroutines
// simultaneously.
