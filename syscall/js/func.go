// FuncOf returns a function to be used by JavaScript.
//
// The Go function fn is called with the value of JavaScript's "this" keyword and the
// arguments of the invocation. The return value of the invocation is
// the result of the Go function mapped back to JavaScript according to ValueOf.
//
// Invoking the wrapped Go function from JavaScript will
// pause the event loop and spawn a new goroutine.
// Other wrapped functions which are triggered during a call from Go to JavaScript
// get executed on the same goroutine.
//
// As a consequence, if one wrapped function blocks, JavaScript's event loop
// is blocked until that function returns. Hence, calling any async JavaScript
// API, which requires the event loop, like fetch (http.Client), will cause an
// immediate deadlock. Therefore a blocking function should explicitly start a
// new goroutine.
//
// Func.Release must be called to free up resources when the function will not be invoked any more.
func FuncOf(fn func(this Value, args []Value) any) Func

// Release frees up resources allocated for the function.
// The function must not be invoked after calling Release.
// It is allowed to call Release while the function is still running.
func (c Func) Release()
