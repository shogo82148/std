// Windows UTF-16 strings can contain unpaired surrogates, which can't be
// decoded into a valid UTF-8 string. This file defines a set of functions
// that can be used to encode and decode potentially ill-formed UTF-16 strings
// by using the [the WTF-8 encoding](https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/).
//
// WTF-8 is a strict superset of UTF-8, i.e. any string that is
// well-formed in UTF-8 is also well-formed in WTF-8 and the content
// is unchanged. Also, the conversion never fails and is lossless.
//
// The benefit of using WTF-8 instead of UTF-8 when decoding a UTF-16 string
// is that the conversion is lossless even for ill-formed UTF-16 strings.
// This property allows to read an ill-formed UTF-16 string, convert it
// to a Go string, and convert it back to the same original UTF-16 string.
//
// See go.dev/issues/59971 for more info.
