// Generate tables for small malloc size classes.
//
// See malloc.go for overview.
//
// The size classes are chosen so that rounding an allocation
// request up to the next size class wastes at most 12.5% (1.125x).
//
// Each size class has its own page count that gets allocated
// and chopped up when new objects of the size class are needed.
// That page count is chosen so that chopping up the run of
// pages into objects of the given size wastes at most 12.5% (1.125x)
// of the memory. It is not necessary that the cutoff here be
// the same as above.
//
// The two sources of waste multiply, so the worst possible case
// for the above constraints would be that allocations of some
// size might have a 26.6% (1.266x) overhead.
// In practice, only one of the wastes comes into play for a
// given size (sizes < 512 waste mainly on the round-up,
// sizes > 512 waste mainly on the page chopping).
//
// TODO(rsc): Compute max waste for any given size.
