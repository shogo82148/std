package runtime

// Stores the signal handlers registered before Go installed its own.
// These signal handlers will be invoked in cases where Go doesn't want to
// handle a particular signal (e.g., signal occurred on a non-Go thread).
// See sigfwdgo for more information on when the signals are forwarded.
//
// This is read by the signal handler; accesses should use
// atomic.Loaduintptr and atomic.Storeuintptr.

// handlingSig is indexed by signal number and is non-zero if we are
// currently handling the signal. Or, to put it another way, whether
// the signal handler is currently set to the Go signal handler or not.
// This is uint32 rather than bool so that we can use atomic instructions.

// channels for synchronizing signal mask updates with the signal mask
// thread

// gsignalStack saves the fields of the gsignal stack changed by
// setGsignalStack.
