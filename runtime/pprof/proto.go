// A profileBuilder writes a profile incrementally from a

// symbolizeFlag keeps track of symbolization result.
//   0                  : no symbol lookup was performed

// pcDeck is a helper to detect a sequence of inlined functions from
// a stack trace returned by the runtime.
//
// The stack traces returned by runtime's trackback functions are fully
// expanded (at least for Go functions) and include the fake pcs representing
// inlined functions. The profile proto expects the inlined functions to be
// encoded in one Location message.

//
// Runtime does not directly expose whether a frame is for an inlined function
// and looking up debug info is not ideal, so we use a heuristic to filter
// the fake pcs and restore the inlined and entry functions. Inlined functions
// have the following properties:
//   Frame's Func is nil (note: also true for non-Go functions), and
//   Frame's Entry matches its entry function frame's Entry (note: could also be true for recursive calls and non-Go functions), and
//   Frame's Name does not match its entry function frame's name (note: inlined functions cannot be directly recursive).
//
// As reading and processing the pcs in a stack trace one by one (from leaf to the root),
// we use pcDeck to temporarily hold the observed pcs and their expanded frames
// until we observe the entry function frame.
