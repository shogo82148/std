// Package pprof writes runtime profiling data in the format expected
// by the pprof visualization tool.
//
// # Profiling a Go program
//
// The first step to profiling a Go program is to enable profiling.
// Support for profiling benchmarks built with the standard testing
// package is built into go test. For example, the following command
// runs benchmarks in the current directory and writes the CPU and
// memory profiles to cpu.prof and mem.prof:
//
//	go test -cpuprofile cpu.prof -memprofile mem.prof -bench .
//
// To add equivalent profiling support to a standalone program, add
// code like the following to your main function:
//
//	var cpuprofile = flag.String("cpuprofile", "", "write cpu profile to `file`")
//	var memprofile = flag.String("memprofile", "", "write memory profile to `file`")
//
//	func main() {
//	    flag.Parse()
//	    if *cpuprofile != "" {
//	        f, err := os.Create(*cpuprofile)
//	        if err != nil {
//	            log.Fatal("could not create CPU profile: ", err)
//	        }
//	        if err := pprof.StartCPUProfile(f); err != nil {
//	            log.Fatal("could not start CPU profile: ", err)
//	        }
//	        defer pprof.StopCPUProfile()
//	    }
//
//	    // ... rest of the program ...
//
//	    if *memprofile != "" {
//	        f, err := os.Create(*memprofile)
//	        if err != nil {
//	            log.Fatal("could not create memory profile: ", err)
//	        }
//	        runtime.GC() // get up-to-date statistics
//	        if err := pprof.WriteHeapProfile(f); err != nil {
//	            log.Fatal("could not write memory profile: ", err)
//	        }
//	        f.Close()
//	    }
//	}
//
// There is also a standard HTTP interface to profiling data. Adding
// the following line will install handlers under the /debug/pprof/
// URL to download live profiles:
//
//	import _ "net/http/pprof"
//
// See the net/http/pprof package for more details.
//
// Profiles can then be visualized with the pprof tool:
//
//	go tool pprof cpu.prof
//
// There are many commands available from the pprof command line.
// Commonly used commands include "top", which prints a summary of the
// top program hot-spots, and "web", which opens an interactive graph
// of hot-spots and their call graphs. Use "help" for information on
// all pprof commands.
//
// For more information about pprof, see
// https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/doc/README.md.

// A Profile is a collection of stack traces showing the call sequences
// that led to instances of a particular event, such as allocation.
// Packages can create and maintain their own profiles; the most common
// use is for tracking resources that must be explicitly closed, such as files
// or network connections.
//
// A Profile's methods can be called from multiple goroutines simultaneously.
//
// Each Profile has a unique name. A few profiles are predefined:
//
//	goroutine    - stack traces of all current goroutines
//	heap         - a sampling of memory allocations of live objects
//	allocs       - a sampling of all past memory allocations
//	threadcreate - stack traces that led to the creation of new OS threads
//	block        - stack traces that led to blocking on synchronization primitives
//	mutex        - stack traces of holders of contended mutexes
//
// These predefined profiles maintain themselves and panic on an explicit
// Add or Remove method call.
//
// The heap profile reports statistics as of the most recently completed
// garbage collection; it elides more recent allocation to avoid skewing
// the profile away from live data and toward garbage.
// If there has been no garbage collection at all, the heap profile reports
// all known allocations. This exception helps mainly in programs running
// without garbage collection enabled, usually for debugging purposes.
//
// The heap profile tracks both the allocation sites for all live objects in
// the application memory and for all objects allocated since the program start.
// Pprof's -inuse_space, -inuse_objects, -alloc_space, and -alloc_objects
// flags select which to display, defaulting to -inuse_space (live objects,
// scaled by size).
//
// The allocs profile is the same as the heap profile but changes the default
// pprof display to -alloc_space, the total number of bytes allocated since
// the program began (including garbage-collected bytes).
//
// The CPU profile is not available as a Profile. It has a special API,
// the StartCPUProfile and StopCPUProfile functions, because it streams
// output to a writer during profiling.

	name  string

// profiles records all registered profiles.

// NewProfile creates a new profile with the given name.
// If a profile with that name already exists, NewProfile panics.
// The convention is to use a 'import/path.' prefix to create
// separate name spaces for each package.
// For compatibility with various tools that read pprof data,
// profile names should not contain spaces.
func NewProfile(name string) *Profile

// Lookup returns the profile with the given name, or nil if no such profile exists.
func Lookup(name string) *Profile

// Profiles returns a slice of all the known profiles, sorted by name.
func Profiles() []*Profile

// Name returns this profile's name, which can be passed to Lookup to reobtain the profile.
func (p *Profile) Name() string

// Count returns the number of execution stacks currently in the profile.
func (p *Profile) Count() int

// Add adds the current execution stack to the profile, associated with value.
// Add stores value in an internal map, so value must be suitable for use as
// a map key and will not be garbage collected until the corresponding
// call to Remove. Add panics if the profile already contains a stack for value.
//
// The skip parameter has the same meaning as runtime.Caller's skip
// and controls where the stack trace begins. Passing skip=0 begins the
// trace in the function calling Add. For example, given this
// execution stack:
//
//	Add
//	called from rpc.NewClient
//	called from mypkg.Run
//	called from main.main
//
// Passing skip=0 begins the stack trace at the call to Add inside rpc.NewClient.
// Passing skip=1 begins the stack trace at the call to NewClient inside mypkg.Run.
func (p *Profile) Add(value interface{}, skip int)

// Remove removes the execution stack associated with value from the profile.
// It is a no-op if the value is not in the profile.
func (p *Profile) Remove(value interface{})

// WriteTo writes a pprof-formatted snapshot of the profile to w.
// If a write to w returns an error, WriteTo returns that error.
// Otherwise, WriteTo returns nil.
//
// The debug parameter enables additional output.
// Passing debug=0 prints only the hexadecimal addresses that pprof needs.
// Passing debug=1 adds comments translating addresses to function names
// and line numbers, so that a programmer can read the profile without tools.
//
// The predefined profiles may assign meaning to other debug values;
// for example, when printing the "goroutine" profile, debug=2 means to
// print the goroutine stacks in the same form that a Go program uses
// when dying due to an unrecovered panic.
func (p *Profile) WriteTo(w io.Writer, debug int) error

// A countProfile is a set of stack traces to be printed as counts
// grouped by stack trace. There are multiple implementations:
// all that matters is that we can find out how many traces there are
// and obtain each trace in turn.

// keysByCount sorts keys with higher counts first, breaking ties by key string order.

// WriteHeapProfile is shorthand for Lookup("heap").WriteTo(w, 0).
// It is preserved for backwards compatibility.
func WriteHeapProfile(w io.Writer) error

// StartCPUProfile enables CPU profiling for the current process.
// While profiling, the profile will be buffered and written to w.
// StartCPUProfile returns an error if profiling is already enabled.
//
// On Unix-like systems, StartCPUProfile does not work by default for
// Go code built with -buildmode=c-archive or -buildmode=c-shared.
// StartCPUProfile relies on the SIGPROF signal, but that signal will
// be delivered to the main program's SIGPROF signal handler (if any)
// not to the one used by Go. To make it work, call os/signal.Notify
// for syscall.SIGPROF, but note that doing so may break any profiling
// being done by the main program.
func StartCPUProfile(w io.Writer) error

// StopCPUProfile stops the current CPU profile, if any.
// StopCPUProfile only returns after all the writes for the
// profile have completed.
func StopCPUProfile()
