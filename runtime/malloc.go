// Memory allocator.
//
// This was originally based on tcmalloc, but has diverged quite a bit.
// http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html

// The main allocator works in runs of pages.
// Small allocation sizes (up to and including 32 kB) are
// rounded to one of about 70 size classes, each of which
// has its own free set of objects of exactly that size.
// Any free page of memory can be split into a set of objects
// of one size class, which are then managed using a free bitmap.
//
// The allocator's data structures are:
//
//	fixalloc: a free-list allocator for fixed-size off-heap objects,
//		used to manage storage used by the allocator.
//	mheap: the malloc heap, managed at page (8192-byte) granularity.
//	mspan: a run of pages managed by the mheap.
//	mcentral: collects all spans of a given size class.
//	mcache: a per-P cache of mspans with free space.
//	mstats: allocation statistics.
//
// Allocating a small object proceeds up a hierarchy of caches:
//
//	1. Round the size up to one of the small size classes
//	   and look in the corresponding mspan in this P's mcache.
//	   Scan the mspan's free bitmap to find a free slot.
//	   If there is a free slot, allocate it.
//	   This can all be done without acquiring a lock.
//
//	2. If the mspan has no free slots, obtain a new mspan
//	   from the mcentral's list of mspans of the required size
//	   class that have free space.
//	   Obtaining a whole span amortizes the cost of locking
//	   the mcentral.
//
//	3. If the mcentral's mspan list is empty, obtain a run
//	   of pages from the mheap to use for the mspan.
//
//	4. If the mheap is empty or has no page runs large enough,
//	   allocate a new group of pages (at least 1MB) from the
//	   operating system. Allocating a large run of pages
//	   amortizes the cost of talking to the operating system.
//
// Sweeping an mspan and freeing objects on it proceeds up a similar
// hierarchy:
//
//	1. If the mspan is being swept in response to allocation, it
//	   is returned to the mcache to satisfy the allocation.
//
//	2. Otherwise, if the mspan still has allocated objects in it,
//	   it is placed on the mcentral free list for the mspan's size
//	   class.
//
//	3. Otherwise, if all objects in the mspan are free, the mspan
//	   is now "idle", so it is returned to the mheap and no longer
//	   has a size class.
//	   This may coalesce it with adjacent idle mspans.
//
//	4. If an mspan remains idle for long enough, return its pages
//	   to the operating system.
//
// Allocating and freeing a large object uses the mheap
// directly, bypassing the mcache and mcentral.
//
// Free object slots in an mspan are zeroed only if mspan.needzero is
// false. If needzero is true, objects are zeroed as they are
// allocated. There are various benefits to delaying zeroing this way:
//
//	1. Stack frame allocation can avoid zeroing altogether.
//
//	2. It exhibits better temporal locality, since the program is
//	   probably about to write to the memory.
//
//	3. We don't zero pages that never get reused.

// Virtual memory layout
//
// The heap consists of a set of arenas, which are 64MB on 64-bit and
// 4MB on 32-bit (heapArenaBytes). Each arena's start address is also
// aligned to the arena size.
//
// Each arena has an associated heapArena object that stores the
// metadata for that arena: the heap bitmap for all words in the arena
// and the span map for all pages in the arena. heapArena objects are
// themselves allocated off-heap.
//
// Since arenas are aligned, the address space can be viewed as a
// series of arena frames. The arena map (mheap_.arenas) maps from
// arena frame number to *heapArena, or nil for parts of the address
// space not backed by the Go heap. The arena map is structured as a
// two-level array consisting of a "L1" arena map and many "L2" arena
// maps; however, since arenas are large, on many architectures, the
// arena map consists of a single, large L2 map.
//
// The arena map covers the entire possible address space, allowing
// the Go heap to use any part of the address space. The allocator
// attempts to keep arenas contiguous so that large spans (and hence
// large objects) can cross arenas.

package runtime

// physPageSize is the size in bytes of the OS's physical pages.
// Mapping and unmapping operations must be done at multiples of
// physPageSize.
//
// This must be set by the OS init code (typically in osinit) before
// mallocinit.

// base address for all 0-byte allocations

// persistentChunkSize is the number of bytes we allocate when we grow
// a persistentAlloc.

// persistentChunks is a list of all the persistent chunks we have
// allocated. The list is maintained through the first word in the
// persistent chunk. This is updated atomically.

// linearAlloc is a simple linear allocator that pre-reserves a region
// of memory and then maps that region as needed. The caller is
// responsible for locking.

// notInHeap is off-heap memory allocated by a lower-level allocator
// like sysAlloc or persistentAlloc.
//
// In general, it's better to use real types marked as go:notinheap,
// but this serves as a generic type for situations where that isn't
// possible (like in the allocators).
//
// TODO: Use this as the return type of sysAlloc, persistentAlloc, etc?
//
//go:notinheap
