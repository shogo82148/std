// A godebugInc provides access to internal/godebug's IncNonDefault function
// for a given GODEBUG setting.
// Calls before internal/godebug registers itself are dropped on the floor.

// so x/sys/cpu can assume the getAuxv symbol exists without keeping its list
// of auxv-using GOOS build tags in sync.
