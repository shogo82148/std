// SetCgoTraceback records three C functions to use to gather
// traceback information from C code and to convert that traceback
// information into symbolic information. These are used when printing
// stack traces for a program that uses cgo.
//
// The traceback and context functions may be called from a signal
// handler, and must therefore use only async-signal safe functions.
// The symbolizer function may be called while the program is
// crashing, and so must be cautious about using memory.  None of the
// functions may call back into Go.
//
// The context function will be called with a single argument, a
// pointer to a struct:
//
//	struct {
//		Context uintptr
//	}
//
// In C syntax, this struct will be
//
//	struct {
//		uintptr_t Context;
//	};
//
// If the Context field is 0, the context function is being called to
// record the current traceback context. It should record in the
// Context field whatever information is needed about the current
// point of execution to later produce a stack trace, probably the
// stack pointer and PC. In this case the context function will be
// called from C code.
//
// If the Context field is not 0, then it is a value returned by a
// previous call to the context function. This case is called when the
// context is no longer needed; that is, when the Go code is returning
// to its C code caller. This permits the context function to release
// any associated resources.
//
// While it would be correct for the context function to record a
// complete a stack trace whenever it is called, and simply copy that
// out in the traceback function, in a typical program the context
// function will be called many times without ever recording a
// traceback for that context. Recording a complete stack trace in a
// call to the context function is likely to be inefficient.
//
// The traceback function will be called with a single argument, a
// pointer to a struct:
//
//	struct {
//		Context    uintptr
//		SigContext uintptr
//		Buf        *uintptr
//		Max        uintptr
//	}
//
// In C syntax, this struct will be
//
//	struct {
//		uintptr_t  Context;
//		uintptr_t  SigContext;
//		uintptr_t* Buf;
//		uintptr_t  Max;
//	};
//
// The Context field will be zero to gather a traceback from the
// current program execution point. In this case, the traceback
// function will be called from C code.
//
// Otherwise Context will be a value previously returned by a call to
// the context function. The traceback function should gather a stack
// trace from that saved point in the program execution. The traceback
// function may be called from an execution thread other than the one
// that recorded the context, but only when the context is known to be
// valid and unchanging. The traceback function may also be called
// deeper in the call stack on the same thread that recorded the
// context. The traceback function may be called multiple times with
// the same Context value; it will usually be appropriate to cache the
// result, if possible, the first time this is called for a specific
// context value.
//
// If the traceback function is called from a signal handler on a Unix
// system, SigContext will be the signal context argument passed to
// the signal handler (a C ucontext_t* cast to uintptr_t). This may be
// used to start tracing at the point where the signal occurred. If
// the traceback function is not called from a signal handler,
// SigContext will be zero.
//
// Buf is where the traceback information should be stored. It should
// be PC values, such that Buf[0] is the PC of the caller, Buf[1] is
// the PC of that function's caller, and so on.  Max is the maximum
// number of entries to store.  The function should store a zero to
// indicate the top of the stack, or that the caller is on a different
// stack, presumably a Go stack.
//
// Unlike runtime.Callers, the PC values returned should, when passed
// to the symbolizer function, return the file/line of the call
// instruction.  No additional subtraction is required or appropriate.
//
// On all platforms, the traceback function is invoked when a call from
// Go to C to Go requests a stack trace. On linux/amd64, linux/ppc64le,
// linux/arm64, and freebsd/amd64, the traceback function is also invoked
// when a signal is received by a thread that is executing a cgo call.
// The traceback function should not make assumptions about when it is
// called, as future versions of Go may make additional calls.
//
// The symbolizer function will be called with a single argument, a
// pointer to a struct:
//
//	struct {
//		PC      uintptr // program counter to fetch information for
//		File    *byte   // file name (NUL terminated)
//		Lineno  uintptr // line number
//		Func    *byte   // function name (NUL terminated)
//		Entry   uintptr // function entry point
//		More    uintptr // set non-zero if more info for this PC
//		Data    uintptr // unused by runtime, available for function
//	}
//
// In C syntax, this struct will be
//
//	struct {
//		uintptr_t PC;
//		char*     File;
//		uintptr_t Lineno;
//		char*     Func;
//		uintptr_t Entry;
//		uintptr_t More;
//		uintptr_t Data;
//	};
//
// The PC field will be a value returned by a call to the traceback
// function.
//
// The first time the function is called for a particular traceback,
// all the fields except PC will be 0. The function should fill in the
// other fields if possible, setting them to 0/nil if the information
// is not available. The Data field may be used to store any useful
// information across calls. The More field should be set to non-zero
// if there is more information for this PC, zero otherwise. If More
// is set non-zero, the function will be called again with the same
// PC, and may return different information (this is intended for use
// with inlined functions). If More is zero, the function will be
// called with the next PC value in the traceback. When the traceback
// is complete, the function will be called once more with PC set to
// zero; this may be used to free any information. Each call will
// leave the fields of the struct set to the same values they had upon
// return, except for the PC field when the More field is zero. The
// function must not keep a copy of the struct pointer between calls.
//
// When calling SetCgoTraceback, the version argument is the version
// number of the structs that the functions expect to receive.
// Currently this must be zero.
//
// The symbolizer function may be nil, in which case the results of
// the traceback function will be displayed as numbers. If the
// traceback function is nil, the symbolizer function will never be
// called. The context function may be nil, in which case the
// traceback function will only be called with the context field set
// to zero.  If the context function is nil, then calls from Go to C
// to Go will not show a traceback for the C portion of the call stack.
//
// SetCgoTraceback should be called only once, ideally from an init function.
