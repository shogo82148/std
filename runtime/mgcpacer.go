// gcController implements the GC pacing controller that determines
// when to trigger concurrent garbage collection and how much marking
// work to do in mutator assists and background marking.
//
// It uses a feedback control algorithm to adjust the gcController.trigger
// trigger based on the heap growth and GC CPU utilization each cycle.
// This algorithm optimizes for heap growth to match GOGC and for CPU
// utilization between assist and background marking to be 25% of
// GOMAXPROCS. The high-level design of this algorithm is documented
// at https://golang.org/s/go15gcpacing.
//
// All fields of gcController are used only during a single mark
// cycle.
