// tflag is documented in reflect/type.go.
//
// tflag values must be kept in sync with copies in:
//	cmd/compile/internal/gc/reflect.go
//	cmd/link/internal/ld/decodesym.go
//	reflect/type.go

// Needs to be in sync with ../cmd/compile/internal/ld/decodesym.go:/^func.commonsize,
// ../cmd/compile/internal/gc/reflect.go:/^func.dcommontype and
// ../reflect/type.go:/^type.rtype.

// reflectOffs holds type offsets defined at run time by the reflect package.
//
// When a type is defined at run time, its *rtype data lives on the heap.
// There are a wide range of possible addresses the heap may use, that
// may not be representable as a 32-bit offset. Moreover the GC may
// one day start moving heap memory, in which case there is no stable
// offset that can be defined.
//
// To provide stable offsets, we add pin *rtype objects in a global map
// and treat the offset as an identifier. We use negative offsets that
// do not overlap with any compile-time module offsets.
//
// Entries are created by reflect.addReflectOff.

// name is an encoded type name with optional extra data.
// See reflect/type.go for details.
