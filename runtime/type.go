package runtime

// rtype is a wrapper that allows us to define additional methods.

// reflectOffs holds type offsets defined at run time by the reflect package.
//
// When a type is defined at run time, its *rtype data lives on the heap.
// There are a wide range of possible addresses the heap may use, that
// may not be representable as a 32-bit offset. Moreover the GC may
// one day start moving heap memory, in which case there is no stable
// offset that can be defined.
//
// To provide stable offsets, we add pin *rtype objects in a global map
// and treat the offset as an identifier. We use negative offsets that
// do not overlap with any compile-time module offsets.
//
// Entries are created by reflect.addReflectOff.
