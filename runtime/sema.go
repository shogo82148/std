// Semaphore implementation exposed to Go.
// Intended use is provide a sleep and wakeup
// primitive that can be used in the contended case
// of other synchronization primitives.
// Thus it targets the same goal as Linux's futex,
// but it has much simpler semantics.
//
// That is, don't think of these as semaphores.
// Think of them as a way to implement sleep and wakeup
// such that every sleep is paired with a single wakeup,
// even if, due to races, the wakeup happens before the sleep.
