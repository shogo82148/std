// Semaphore implementation exposed to Go.
// Intended use is provide a sleep and wakeup
// primitive that can be used in the contended case
// of other synchronization primitives.
// Thus it targets the same goal as Linux's futex,
// but it has much simpler semantics.
//
// That is, don't think of these as semaphores.
// Think of them as a way to implement sleep and wakeup
// such that every sleep is paired with a single wakeup,
// even if, due to races, the wakeup happens before the sleep.

package runtime

// A semaRoot holds a balanced tree of sudog with distinct addresses (s.elem).
// Each of those sudog may in turn point (through s.waitlink) to a list
// of other sudogs waiting on the same address.
// The operations on the inner lists of sudogs with the same address
// are all O(1). The scanning of the top-level semaRoot list is O(log n),
// where n is the number of distinct addresses with goroutines blocked
// on them that hash to the given semaRoot.
// See golang.org/issue/17953 for a program that worked badly
// before we introduced the second level of list, and
// BenchmarkSemTable/OneAddrCollision/* for a benchmark that exercises this.

// Prime to not correlate with any user patterns.

// notifyList is a ticket-based notification list used to implement sync.Cond.
//
// It must be kept in sync with the sync package.
