package runtime

// buffer of pending write data

// Cache of types that have been serialized already.
// We use a type's hash field to pick a bucket.
// Inside a bucket, we keep a list of types that
// have been serialized so far, most recently used first.
// Note: when a bucket overflows we may end up
// serializing a type more than once. That's ok.

// Bit vector of free marks.
// Needs to be as big as the largest number of objects per span.
