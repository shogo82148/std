// Goexit terminates the goroutine that calls it. No other goroutine is affected.
// Goexit runs all deferred calls before terminating the goroutine. Because Goexit
// is not a panic, any recover calls in those deferred functions will return nil.
//
// Calling Goexit from the main goroutine terminates that goroutine
// without func main returning. Since func main has not returned,
// the program continues execution of other goroutines.
// If all other goroutines exit, the program crashes.

// Before Go 1.21, programs that called panic(nil) observed recover returning nil.
// Starting in Go 1.21, programs that call panic(nil) observe recover returning a *PanicNilError.
// Programs can change back to the old behavior by setting GODEBUG=panicnil=1.
