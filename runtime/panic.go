// Goexit terminates the goroutine that calls it. No other goroutine is affected.
// Goexit runs all deferred calls before terminating the goroutine. Because Goexit
// is not panic, however, any recover calls in those deferred functions will return nil.
//
// Calling Goexit from the main goroutine terminates that goroutine
// without func main returning. Since func main has not returned,
// the program continues execution of other goroutines.
// If all other goroutines exit, the program crashes.
