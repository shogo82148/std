package metrics

// Description describes a runtime metric.
type Description struct {
	// Name is the full name of the metric which includes the unit.
	//
	// The format of the metric may be described by the following regular expression.
	//
	// 	^(?P<name>/[^:]+):(?P<unit>[^:*/]+(?:[*/][^:*/]+)*)$
	//
	// The format splits the name into two components, separated by a colon: a path which always
	// starts with a /, and a machine-parseable unit. The name may contain any valid Unicode
	// codepoint in between / characters, but by convention will try to stick to lowercase
	// characters and hyphens. An example of such a path might be "/memory/heap/free".
	//
	// The unit is by convention a series of lowercase English unit names (singular or plural)
	// without prefixes delimited by '*' or '/'. The unit names may contain any valid Unicode
	// codepoint that is not a delimiter.
	// Examples of units might be "seconds", "bytes", "bytes/second", "cpu-seconds",
	// "byte*cpu-seconds", and "bytes/second/second".
	//
	// For histograms, multiple units may apply. For instance, the units of the buckets and
	// the count. By convention, for histograms, the units of the count are always "samples"
	// with the type of sample evident by the metric's name, while the unit in the name
	// specifies the buckets' unit.
	//
	// A complete name might look like "/memory/heap/free:bytes".
	Name string

	// Description is an English language sentence describing the metric.
	Description string

	// Kind is the kind of value for this metric.
	//
	// The purpose of this field is to allow users to filter out metrics whose values are
	// types which their application may not understand.
	Kind ValueKind

	// Cumulative is whether or not the metric is cumulative. If a cumulative metric is just
	// a single number, then it increases monotonically. If the metric is a distribution,
	// then each bucket count increases monotonically.
	//
	// This flag thus indicates whether or not it's useful to compute a rate from this value.
	Cumulative bool
}

// All returns a slice of containing metric descriptions for all supported metrics.
