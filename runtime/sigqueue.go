// This file implements runtime support for signal handling.
//
// Most synchronization primitives are not available from
// the signal handler (it cannot block, allocate memory, or use locks)
// so the handler communicates with a processing goroutine
// via struct sig, below.
//
// sigsend is called by the signal handler to queue a new signal.
// signal_recv is called by the Go program to receive a newly queued signal.
// Synchronization between sigsend and signal_recv is based on the sig.state
// variable. It can be in 4 states: sigIdle, sigReceiving, sigSending and sigFixup.
// sigReceiving means that signal_recv is blocked on sig.Note and there are no
// new pending signals.
// sigSending means that sig.mask *may* contain new pending signals,
// signal_recv can't be blocked in this state.
// sigIdle means that there are no new pending signals and signal_recv is not blocked.
// sigFixup is a transient state that can only exist as a short
// transition from sigReceiving and then on to sigIdle: it is
// used to ensure the AllThreadsSyscall()'s mDoFixup() operation
// occurs on the sleeping m, waiting to receive a signal.
// Transitions between states are done atomically with CAS.
// When signal_recv is unblocked, it resets sig.Note and rechecks sig.mask.
// If several sigsends and signal_recv execute concurrently, it can lead to
// unnecessary rechecks of sig.mask, but it cannot lead to missed signals
// nor deadlocks.

// sig handles communication between the signal handler and os/signal.
// Other than the inuse and recv fields, the fields are accessed atomically.
//
// The wanted and ignored fields are only written by one goroutine at
// a time; access is controlled by the handlers Mutex in os/signal.
// The fields are only read by that one goroutine and by the signal handler.
// We access them atomically to minimize the race between setting them
// in the goroutine calling os/signal and the signal handler,
// which may be running in a different thread. That race is unavoidable,
// as there is no connection between handling a signal and receiving one,
// but atomic instructions should minimize it.
