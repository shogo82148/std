// FixAlloc is a simple free-list allocator for fixed size objects.
// Malloc uses a FixAlloc wrapped around sysAlloc to manage its
// mcache and mspan objects.
//
// Memory returned by fixalloc.alloc is zeroed by default, but the
// caller may take responsibility for zeroing allocations by setting
// the zero flag to false. This is only safe if the memory never
// contains heap pointers.
//
// The caller is responsible for locking around FixAlloc calls.
// Callers can keep state in the object but the first word is
// smashed by freeing and reallocating.
//
// Consider marking fixalloc'd types not in heap by embedding
// runtime/internal/sys.NotInHeap.

// A generic linked list of blocks.  (Typically the block is bigger than sizeof(MLink).)
// Since assignments to mlink.next will result in a write barrier being performed
// this cannot be used by some of the internal GC structures. For example when
// the sweeper is placing an unmarked object on the free list it does not want the
// write barrier to be called since that could result in the object being reachable.
