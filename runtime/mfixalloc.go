// FixAlloc is a simple free-list allocator for fixed size objects.
// Malloc uses a FixAlloc wrapped around sysAlloc to manages its
// MCache and MSpan objects.
//
// Memory returned by FixAlloc_Alloc is not zeroed.
// The caller is responsible for locking around FixAlloc calls.
// Callers can keep state in the object but the first word is
// smashed by freeing and reallocating.

// A generic linked list of blocks.  (Typically the block is bigger than sizeof(MLink).)
// Since assignments to mlink.next will result in a write barrier being preformed
// this can not be used by some of the internal GC structures. For example when
// the sweeper is placing an unmarked object on the free list it does not want the
// write barrier to be called since that could result in the object being reachable.
