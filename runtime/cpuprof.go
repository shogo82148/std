// CPU profiling.
// Based on algorithms and data structures used in
// http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools/.
//
// The main difference between this code and the google-perftools
// code is that this code is written to allow copying the profile data
// to an arbitrary io.Writer, while the google-perftools code always
// writes to an operating system file.
//
// The signal handler for the profiling clock tick adds a new stack trace
// to a hash table tracking counts for recent traces.  Most clock ticks
// hit in the cache.  In the event of a cache miss, an entry must be
// evicted from the hash table, copied to a log that will eventually be
// written as profile data.  The google-perftools code flushed the
// log itself during the signal handler.  This code cannot do that, because
// the io.Writer might block or need system calls or locks that are not
// safe to use from within the signal handler.  Instead, we split the log
// into two halves and let the signal handler fill one half while a goroutine
// is writing out the other half.  When the signal handler fills its half, it
// offers to swap with the goroutine.  If the writer is not done with its half,
// we lose the stack trace for this clock tick (and record that loss).
// The goroutine interacts with the signal handler by calling getprofile() to
// get the next log piece to write, implicitly handing back the last log
// piece it obtained.
//
// The state of this dance between the signal handler and the goroutine
// is encoded in the Profile.handoff field.  If handoff == 0, then the goroutine
// is not using either log half and is waiting (or will soon be waiting) for
// a new piece by calling notesleep(&p->wait).  If the signal handler
// changes handoff from 0 to non-zero, it must call notewakeup(&p->wait)
// to wake the goroutine.  The value indicates the number of entries in the
// log half being handed off.  The goroutine leaves the non-zero value in
// place until it has finished processing the log half and then flips the number
// back to zero.  Setting the high bit in handoff means that the profiling is over,
// and the goroutine is now in charge of flushing the data left in the hash table
// to the log and returning that data.
//
// The handoff field is manipulated using atomic operations.
// For the most part, the manipulation of handoff is orderly: if handoff == 0
// then the signal handler owns it and can change it to non-zero.
// If handoff != 0 then the goroutine owns it and can change it to zero.
// If that were the end of the story then we would not need to manipulate
// handoff using atomic operations.  The operations are needed, however,
// in order to let the log closer set the high bit to indicate "EOF" safely
// in the situation when normally the goroutine "owns" handoff.

// SetCPUProfileRate sets the CPU profiling rate to hz samples per second.
// If hz <= 0, SetCPUProfileRate turns off profiling.
// If the profiler is on, the rate cannot be changed without first turning it off.

// Most clients should use the runtime/pprof package or
// the testing package's -test.cpuprofile flag instead of calling
// SetCPUProfileRate directly.
func SetCPUProfileRate(hz int)

// CPUProfile returns the next chunk of binary CPU profiling stack trace data,
// blocking until data is available.  If profiling is turned off and all the profile
// data accumulated while it was on has been returned, CPUProfile returns nil.
// The caller must save the returned data before calling CPUProfile again.
