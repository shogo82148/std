package runtime

// Error codes returned by runtime_pollReset and runtime_pollWait.
// These must match the values in internal/poll/fd_poll_runtime.go.

// pollDesc contains 2 binary semaphores, rg and wg, to park reader and writer
// goroutines respectively. The semaphore can be in the following states:
// pdReady - io readiness notification is pending;
//           a goroutine consumes the notification by changing the state to nil.
// pdWait - a goroutine prepares to park on the semaphore, but not yet parked;
//          the goroutine commits to park by changing the state to G pointer,
//          or, alternatively, concurrent io notification changes the state to pdReady,
//          or, alternatively, concurrent timeout/close changes the state to nil.
// G pointer - the goroutine is blocked on the semaphore;
//             io notification or timeout/close changes the state to pdReady or nil respectively
//             and unparks the goroutine.
// nil - none of the above.

// Network poller descriptor.
//
// No heap pointers.
//
//go:notinheap

// pollInfo is the bits needed by netpollcheckerr, stored atomically,
// mostly duplicating state that is manipulated under lock in pollDesc.
// The one exception is the pollEventErr bit, which is maintained only
// in the pollInfo.
