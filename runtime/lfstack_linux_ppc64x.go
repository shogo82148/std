// On ppc64, Linux limits the user address space to 46 bits (see
// TASK_SIZE_USER64 in the Linux kernel).  This has grown over time,
// so here we allow 48 bit addresses.
//
// In addition to the 16 bits taken from the top, we can take 3 from the
// bottom, because node must be pointer-aligned, giving a total of 19 bits
// of count.
