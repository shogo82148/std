// Garbage collector: type and heap bitmaps.
//
// Stack, data, and bss bitmaps
//
// Stack frames and global variables in the data and bss sections are described
// by 1-bit bitmaps in which 0 means uninteresting and 1 means live pointer
// to be visited during GC. The bits in each byte are consumed starting with
// the low bit: 1<<0, 1<<1, and so on.
//
// Heap bitmap
//
// The allocated heap comes from a subset of the memory in the range [start, used),
// where start == mheap_.arena_start and used == mheap_.arena_used.
// The heap bitmap comprises 2 bits for each pointer-sized word in that range,
// stored in bytes indexed backward in memory from start.
// That is, the byte at address start-1 holds the 2-bit entries for the four words
// start through start+3*ptrSize, the byte at start-2 holds the entries for
// start+4*ptrSize through start+7*ptrSize, and so on.
//
// In each 2-bit entry, the lower bit holds the same information as in the 1-bit
// bitmaps: 0 means uninteresting and 1 means live pointer to be visited during GC.
// The meaning of the high bit depends on the position of the word being described
// in its allocated object. In the first word, the high bit is the GC ``marked'' bit.
// In the second word, the high bit is the GC ``checkmarked'' bit (see below).
// In the third and later words, the high bit indicates that the object is still
// being described. In these words, if a bit pair with a high bit 0 is encountered,
// the low bit can also be assumed to be 0, and the object description is over.
// This 00 is called the ``dead'' encoding: it signals that the rest of the words
// in the object are uninteresting to the garbage collector.
//
// The 2-bit entries are split when written into the byte, so that the top half
// of the byte contains 4 mark bits and the bottom half contains 4 pointer bits.
// This form allows a copy from the 1-bit to the 4-bit form to keep the
// pointer bits contiguous, instead of having to space them out.
//
// The code makes use of the fact that the zero value for a heap bitmap
// has no live pointer bit set and is (depending on position), not marked,
// not checkmarked, and is the dead encoding.
// These properties must be preserved when modifying the encoding.
//
// Checkmarks
//
// In a concurrent garbage collector, one worries about failing to mark
// a live object due to mutations without write barriers or bugs in the
// collector implementation. As a sanity check, the GC has a 'checkmark'
// mode that retraverses the object graph with the world stopped, to make
// sure that everything that should be marked is marked.
// In checkmark mode, in the heap bitmap, the high bit of the 2-bit entry
// for the second word of the object holds the checkmark bit.
// When not in checkmark mode, this bit is set to 1.
//
// The smallest possible allocation is 8 bytes. On a 32-bit machine, that
// means every allocated object has two words, so there is room for the
// checkmark bit. On a 64-bit machine, however, the 8-byte allocation is
// just one word, so the second bit pair is not available for encoding the
// checkmark. However, because non-pointer allocations are combined
// into larger 16-byte (maxTinySize) allocations, a plain 8-byte allocation
// must be a pointer, so the type bit in the first word is not actually needed.
// It is still used in general, except in checkmark the type bit is repurposed
// as the checkmark bit and then reinitialized (to 1) as the type bit when
// finished.

package runtime

// heapBits provides access to the bitmap bits for a single heap word.
// The methods on heapBits take value receivers so that the compiler
// can more easily inline calls to those methods and registerize the
// struct fields independently.
