// Garbage collector: finalizers and block profiling.

package runtime

// SetFinalizer sets the finalizer associated with obj to the provided
// finalizer function. When the garbage collector finds an unreachable block
// with an associated finalizer, it clears the association and runs
// finalizer(obj) in a separate goroutine. This makes obj reachable again,
// but now without an associated finalizer. Assuming that SetFinalizer
// is not called again, the next time the garbage collector sees
// that obj is unreachable, it will free obj.
//
// SetFinalizer(obj, nil) clears any finalizer associated with obj.
//
// The argument obj must be a pointer to an object allocated by calling
// new, by taking the address of a composite literal, or by taking the
// address of a local variable.
// The argument finalizer must be a function that takes a single argument
// to which obj's type can be assigned, and can have arbitrary ignored return
// values. If either of these is not true, SetFinalizer may abort the
// program.
//
// Finalizers are run in dependency order: if A points at B, both have
// finalizers, and they are otherwise unreachable, only the finalizer
// for A runs; once A is freed, the finalizer for B can run.
// If a cyclic structure includes a block with a finalizer, that
// cycle is not guaranteed to be garbage collected and the finalizer
// is not guaranteed to run, because there is no ordering that
// respects the dependencies.
//
// The finalizer is scheduled to run at some arbitrary time after the
// program can no longer reach the object to which obj points.
// There is no guarantee that finalizers will run before a program exits,
// so typically they are useful only for releasing non-memory resources
// associated with an object during a long-running program.
// For example, an [os.File] object could use a finalizer to close the
// associated operating system file descriptor when a program discards
// an os.File without calling Close, but it would be a mistake
// to depend on a finalizer to flush an in-memory I/O buffer such as a
// [bufio.Writer], because the buffer would not be flushed at program exit.
//
// It is not guaranteed that a finalizer will run if the size of *obj is
// zero bytes, because it may share same address with other zero-size
// objects in memory. See https://go.dev/ref/spec#Size_and_alignment_guarantees.
//
// It is not guaranteed that a finalizer will run for objects allocated
// in initializers for package-level variables. Such objects may be
// linker-allocated, not heap-allocated.
//
// Note that because finalizers may execute arbitrarily far into the future
// after an object is no longer referenced, the runtime is allowed to perform
// a space-saving optimization that batches objects together in a single
// allocation slot. The finalizer for an unreferenced object in such an
// allocation may never run if it always exists in the same batch as a
// referenced object. Typically, this batching only happens for tiny
// (on the order of 16 bytes or less) and pointer-free objects.
//
// A finalizer may run as soon as an object becomes unreachable.
// In order to use finalizers correctly, the program must ensure that
// the object is reachable until it is no longer required.
// Objects stored in global variables, or that can be found by tracing
// pointers from a global variable, are reachable. For other objects,
// pass the object to a call of the [KeepAlive] function to mark the
// last point in the function where the object must be reachable.
//
// For example, if p points to a struct, such as os.File, that contains
// a file descriptor d, and p has a finalizer that closes that file
// descriptor, and if the last use of p in a function is a call to
// syscall.Write(p.d, buf, size), then p may be unreachable as soon as
// the program enters [syscall.Write]. The finalizer may run at that moment,
// closing p.d, causing syscall.Write to fail because it is writing to
// a closed file descriptor (or, worse, to an entirely different
// file descriptor opened by a different goroutine). To avoid this problem,
// call KeepAlive(p) after the call to syscall.Write.
//
// A single goroutine runs all finalizers for a program, sequentially.
// If a finalizer must run for a long time, it should do so by starting
// a new goroutine.
//
// In the terminology of the Go memory model, a call
// SetFinalizer(x, f) “synchronizes before” the finalization call f(x).
// However, there is no guarantee that KeepAlive(x) or any other use of x
// “synchronizes before” f(x), so in general a finalizer should use a mutex
// or other synchronization mechanism if it needs to access mutable state in x.
// For example, consider a finalizer that inspects a mutable field in x
// that is modified from time to time in the main program before x
// becomes unreachable and the finalizer is invoked.
// The modifications in the main program and the inspection in the finalizer
// need to use appropriate synchronization, such as mutexes or atomic updates,
// to avoid read-write races.
func SetFinalizer(obj any, finalizer any)

// KeepAlive marks its argument as currently reachable.
// This ensures that the object is not freed, and its finalizer is not run,
// before the point in the program where KeepAlive is called.
//
// A very simplified example showing where KeepAlive is required:
//
//	type File struct { d int }
//	d, err := syscall.Open("/file/path", syscall.O_RDONLY, 0)
//	// ... do something if err != nil ...
//	p := &File{d}
//	runtime.SetFinalizer(p, func(p *File) { syscall.Close(p.d) })
//	var buf [10]byte
//	n, err := syscall.Read(p.d, buf[:])
//	// Ensure p is not finalized until Read returns.
//	runtime.KeepAlive(p)
//	// No more uses of p after this point.
//
// Without the KeepAlive call, the finalizer could run at the start of
// [syscall.Read], closing the file descriptor before syscall.Read makes
// the actual system call.
//
// Note: KeepAlive should only be used to prevent finalizers from
// running prematurely. In particular, when used with [unsafe.Pointer],
// the rules for valid uses of unsafe.Pointer still apply.
func KeepAlive(x any)
