// Garbage collector: finalizers and block profiling.

package runtime

// finblock is an array of finalizers to be executed. finblocks are
// arranged in a linked list for the finalizer queue.
//
// finblock is allocated from non-GC'd memory, so any heap pointers
// must be specially handled. GC currently assumes that the finalizer
// queue does not grow during marking (but it can shrink).
//
//go:notinheap

// NOTE: Layout known to queuefinalizer.

// SetFinalizer sets the finalizer associated with obj to the provided
// finalizer function. When the garbage collector finds an unreachable block
// with an associated finalizer, it clears the association and runs
// finalizer(obj) in a separate goroutine. This makes obj reachable again,
// but now without an associated finalizer. Assuming that SetFinalizer
// is not called again, the next time the garbage collector sees
// that obj is unreachable, it will free obj.
//
// SetFinalizer(obj, nil) clears any finalizer associated with obj.
//
// The argument obj must be a pointer to an object allocated by calling
// new, by taking the address of a composite literal, or by taking the
// address of a local variable.
// The argument finalizer must be a function that takes a single argument
// to which obj's type can be assigned, and can have arbitrary ignored return
// values. If either of these is not true, SetFinalizer may abort the
// program.
//
// Finalizers are run in dependency order: if A points at B, both have
// finalizers, and they are otherwise unreachable, only the finalizer
// for A runs; once A is freed, the finalizer for B can run.
// If a cyclic structure includes a block with a finalizer, that
// cycle is not guaranteed to be garbage collected and the finalizer
// is not guaranteed to run, because there is no ordering that
// respects the dependencies.
//
// The finalizer for obj is scheduled to run at some arbitrary time after
// obj becomes unreachable.
// There is no guarantee that finalizers will run before a program exits,
// so typically they are useful only for releasing non-memory resources
// associated with an object during a long-running program.
// For example, an os.File object could use a finalizer to close the
// associated operating system file descriptor when a program discards
// an os.File without calling Close, but it would be a mistake
// to depend on a finalizer to flush an in-memory I/O buffer such as a
// bufio.Writer, because the buffer would not be flushed at program exit.
//
// It is not guaranteed that a finalizer will run if the size of *obj is
// zero bytes.
//
// It is not guaranteed that a finalizer will run for objects allocated
// in initializers for package-level variables. Such objects may be
// linker-allocated, not heap-allocated.
//
// A finalizer may run as soon as an object becomes unreachable.
// In order to use finalizers correctly, the program must ensure that
// the object is reachable until it is no longer required.
// Objects stored in global variables, or that can be found by tracing
// pointers from a global variable, are reachable. For other objects,
// pass the object to a call of the KeepAlive function to mark the
// last point in the function where the object must be reachable.
//
// For example, if p points to a struct that contains a file descriptor d,
// and p has a finalizer that closes that file descriptor, and if the last
// use of p in a function is a call to syscall.Write(p.d, buf, size), then
// p may be unreachable as soon as the program enters syscall.Write. The
// finalizer may run at that moment, closing p.d, causing syscall.Write
// to fail because it is writing to a closed file descriptor (or, worse,
// to an entirely different file descriptor opened by a different goroutine).
// To avoid this problem, call runtime.KeepAlive(p) after the call to
// syscall.Write.
//
// A single goroutine runs all finalizers for a program, sequentially.
// If a finalizer must run for a long time, it should do so by starting
// a new goroutine.
func SetFinalizer(obj interface{}, finalizer interface{})

// KeepAlive marks its argument as currently reachable.
// This ensures that the object is not freed, and its finalizer is not run,
// before the point in the program where KeepAlive is called.
//
// A very simplified example showing where KeepAlive is required:
//
//	type File struct { d int }
//	d, err := syscall.Open("/file/path", syscall.O_RDONLY, 0)
//	// ... do something if err != nil ...
//	p := &File{d}
//	runtime.SetFinalizer(p, func(p *File) { syscall.Close(p.d) })
//	var buf [10]byte
//	n, err := syscall.Read(p.d, buf[:])
//	// Ensure p is not finalized until Read returns.
//	runtime.KeepAlive(p)
//	// No more uses of p after this point.
//
// Without the KeepAlive call, the finalizer could run at the start of
// syscall.Read, closing the file descriptor before syscall.Read makes
// the actual system call.
func KeepAlive(x interface{})
