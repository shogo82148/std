// Garbage collector: write barriers.
//
// For the concurrent garbage collector, the Go compiler implements
// updates to pointer-valued fields that may be in heap objects by
// emitting calls to write barriers. This file contains the actual write barrier
// implementation, markwb, and the various wrappers called by the
// compiler to implement pointer assignment, slice assignment,
// typed memmove, and so on.
