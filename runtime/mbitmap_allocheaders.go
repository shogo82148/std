// Garbage collector: type and heap bitmaps.
//
// Stack, data, and bss bitmaps
//
// Stack frames and global variables in the data and bss sections are
// described by bitmaps with 1 bit per pointer-sized word. A "1" bit
// means the word is a live pointer to be visited by the GC (referred to
// as "pointer"). A "0" bit means the word should be ignored by GC
// (referred to as "scalar", though it could be a dead pointer value).
//
// Heap bitmaps
//
// The heap bitmap comprises 1 bit for each pointer-sized word in the heap,
// recording whether a pointer is stored in that word or not. This bitmap
// is stored at the end of a span for small objects and is unrolled at
// runtime from type metadata for all larger objects. Objects without
// pointers have neither a bitmap nor associated type metadata.
//
// Bits in all cases correspond to words in little-endian order.
//
// For small objects, if s is the mspan for the span starting at "start",
// then s.heapBits() returns a slice containing the bitmap for the whole span.
// That is, s.heapBits()[0] holds the goarch.PtrSize*8 bits for the first
// goarch.PtrSize*8 words from "start" through "start+63*ptrSize" in the span.
// On a related note, small objects are always small enough that their bitmap
// fits in goarch.PtrSize*8 bits, so writing out bitmap data takes two bitmap
// writes at most (because object boundaries don't generally lie on
// s.heapBits()[i] boundaries).
//
// For larger objects, if t is the type for the object starting at "start",
// within some span whose mspan is s, then the bitmap at t.GCData is "tiled"
// from "start" through "start+s.elemsize".
// Specifically, the first bit of t.GCData corresponds to the word at "start",
// the second to the word after "start", and so on up to t.PtrBytes. At t.PtrBytes,
// we skip to "start+t.Size_" and begin again from there. This process is
// repeated until we hit "start+s.elemsize".
// This tiling algorithm supports array data, since the type always refers to
// the element type of the array. Single objects are considered the same as
// single-element arrays.
// The tiling algorithm may scan data past the end of the compiler-recognized
// object, but any unused data within the allocation slot (i.e. within s.elemsize)
// is zeroed, so the GC just observes nil pointers.
// Note that this "tiled" bitmap isn't stored anywhere; it is generated on-the-fly.
//
// For objects without their own span, the type metadata is stored in the first
// word before the object at the beginning of the allocation slot. For objects
// with their own span, the type metadata is stored in the mspan.
//
// The bitmap for small unallocated objects in scannable spans is not maintained
// (can be junk).
