// Mutual exclusion locks.  In the uncontended case,
// as fast as spin locks (just a few user-level instructions),
// but on the contention path they sleep in the kernel.
// A zeroed Mutex is unlocked (no need to initialize each lock).

// sleep and wakeup on one-time events.
// before any calls to notesleep or notewakeup,
// must call noteclear to initialize the Note.
// then, exactly one thread can call notesleep
// and exactly one thread can call notewakeup (once).
// once notewakeup has been called, the notesleep
// will return.  future notesleep will return immediately.
// subsequent noteclear must be called only after
// previous notesleep has returned, e.g. it's disallowed
// to call noteclear straight after notewakeup.
//
// notetsleep is like notesleep but wakes up after
// a given number of nanoseconds even if the event
// has not yet happened.  if a goroutine uses notetsleep to
// wake up early, it must wait to call noteclear until it
// can be sure that no other goroutine is calling
// notewakeup.
//
// notesleep/notetsleep are generally called on g0,
// notetsleepg is similar to notetsleep but is called on user g.

// A guintptr holds a goroutine pointer, but typed as a uintptr
// to bypass write barriers. It is used in the Gobuf goroutine state
// and in scheduling lists that are manipulated without a P.
//
// The Gobuf.g goroutine pointer is almost always updated by assembly code.
// In one of the few places it is updated by Go code - func save - it must be
// treated as a uintptr to avoid a write barrier being emitted at a bad time.
// Instead of figuring out how to emit the write barriers missing in the
// assembly manipulation, we change the type of the field to uintptr,
// so that it does not require write barriers at all.
//
// Goroutine structs are published in the allg list and never freed.
// That will keep the goroutine structs from being collected.
// There is never a time that Gobuf.g's contain the only references
// to a goroutine: the publishing of the goroutine in allg comes first.
// Goroutine pointers are also kept in non-GC-visible places like TLS,
// so I can't see them ever moving. If we did want to start moving data
// in the GC, we'd need to allocate the goroutine structs from an
// alternate arena. Using guintptr doesn't make that problem any worse.

// muintptr is a *m that is not tracked by the garbage collector.
//
// Because we do free Ms, there are some additional constrains on
// muintptrs:
//
// 1. Never hold an muintptr locally across a safe point.
//
// 2. Any muintptr in the heap must be owned by the M itself so it can
//    ensure it is not in use when the last true *m is released.

// sudog represents a g in a wait list, such as for sending/receiving
// on a channel.
//
// sudog is necessary because the g â†” synchronization object relation
// is many-to-many. A g can be on many wait lists, so there may be
// many sudogs for one g; and many gs may be waiting on the same
// synchronization object, so there may be many sudogs for one object.
//
// sudogs are allocated from a special pool. Use acquireSudog and
// releaseSudog to allocate and free them.

// describes how to handle callback

// Stack describes a Go execution stack.
// The bounds of the stack are exactly [lo, hi),
// with no implicit data structures on either side.

// Values for the flags field of a sigTabT.

// Layout of in-memory per-function information prepared by linker
// See https://golang.org/s/go12symtab.
// Keep in sync with linker (../cmd/link/internal/ld/pcln.go:/pclntab)
// and with package debug/gosym and with symtab.go in package runtime.

// Pseudo-Func that is returned for PCs that occur in inlined code.
// A *Func can be either a *_func or a *funcinl, and they are distinguished
// by the first uintptr.

// layout of Itab known to compilers
// allocated in non-garbage-collected memory
// Needs to be in sync with
// ../cmd/compile/internal/gc/reflect.go:/^func.dumptypestructs.

// Lock-free stack node.
// Also known to export_test.go.

// startup_random_data holds random bytes initialized at startup. These come from
// the ELF AT_RANDOM auxiliary vector (vdso_linux_amd64.go or os_linux_386.go).

// A _defer holds an entry on the list of deferred calls.
// If you add a field here, add code to clear it in freedefer.
// This struct must match the code in cmd/compile/internal/gc/reflect.go:deferstruct
// and cmd/compile/internal/gc/ssa.go:(*state).call.
// Some defers will be allocated on the stack and some on the heap.
// All defers are logically part of the stack, so write barriers to
// initialize them are not required. All defers must be manually scanned,
// and for heap defers, marked.

// A _panic holds information about an active panic.
//
// This is marked go:notinheap because _panic values must only ever
// live on the stack.
//
// The argp and link fields are stack pointers, but don't need special
// handling during stack growth: because they are pointer-typed and
// _panic values only live on the stack, regular stack pointer
// adjustment takes care of them.
//
//go:notinheap

// stack traces

// ancestorInfo records details of where a goroutine was started.

// The maximum number of frames we print for a traceback

// A waitReason explains why a goroutine has been stopped.
// See gopark. Do not re-use waitReasons, add new ones.

// Set by the linker so the runtime can determine the buildmode.
