// Package context defines the Context type, which carries deadlines,
// cancelation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries
// and between processes.
//
// Incoming requests to a server should create a Context, and outgoing
// calls to servers should accept a Context. The chain of function
// calls between them must propagate the Context, optionally replacing
// it with a derived Context created using WithCancel, WithDeadline,
// WithTimeout, or WithValue. When a Context is canceled, all
// Contexts derived from it are also canceled.
//
// The WithCancel, WithDeadline, and WithTimeout functions take a
// Context (the parent) and return a derived Context (the child) and a
// CancelFunc. Calling the CancelFunc cancels the child and its
// children, removes the parent's reference to the child, and stops
// any associated timers. Failing to call the CancelFunc leaks the
// child and its children until the parent is canceled or the timer
// fires. The go vet tool checks that CancelFuncs are used on all
// control-flow paths.
//
// Programs that use Contexts should follow these rules to keep interfaces
// consistent across packages and enable static analysis tools to check context
// propagation:
//
// Do not store Contexts inside a struct type; instead, pass a Context
// explicitly to each function that needs it. The Context should be the first
// parameter, typically named ctx:
//
//	func DoSomething(ctx context.Context, arg Arg) error {
//		// ... use ctx ...
//	}
//
// Do not pass a nil Context, even if a function permits it. Pass context.TODO
// if you are unsure about which Context to use.
//
// Use context Values only for request-scoped data that transits processes and
// APIs, not for passing optional parameters to functions.
//
// The same Context may be passed to functions running in different goroutines;
// Contexts are safe for simultaneous use by multiple goroutines.
//
// See https://blog.golang.org/context for example code for a server that uses
// Contexts.

// TODO returns a non-nil, empty Context. Code should use context.TODO when

// WithCancel returns a copy of parent with a new Done channel. The returned
// context's Done channel is closed when the returned cancel function is called

// that implement canceler.

// WithDeadline returns a copy of the parent context with the deadline adjusted
// to be no later than d. If the parent's deadline is already earlier than d,
// WithDeadline(parent, d) is semantically equivalent to parent. The returned
// context's Done channel is closed when the deadline expires, when the returned
// cancel function is called, or when the parent context's Done channel is
// closed, whichever happens first.

// A timerCtx carries a timer and a deadline. It embeds a cancelCtx to
// implement Done and Err. It implements cancel by stopping its timer then

//
// Canceling this context releases resources associated with it, so code should
// call cancel as soon as the operations running in this Context complete:

// WithValue returns a copy of parent in which the value associated with key is
// val.
//
// Use context Values only for request-scoped data that transits processes and
// APIs, not for passing optional parameters to functions.
//
// The provided key must be comparable and should not be of type
// string or any other built-in type to avoid collisions between
// packages using context. Users of WithValue should define their own
// types for keys. To avoid allocating when assigning to an
// interface{}, context keys often have concrete type
// struct{}. Alternatively, exported context key variables' static
// type should be a pointer or interface.
func WithValue(parent Context, key, val interface{}) Context

// A valueCtx carries a key-value pair. It implements Value for that key and
// delegates all other calls to the embedded Context.
