// Package context defines the Context type, which carries deadlines,
// cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries
// and between processes.
//
// Incoming requests to a server should create a [Context], and outgoing
// calls to servers should accept a Context. The chain of function
// calls between them must propagate the Context, optionally replacing
// it with a derived Context created using [WithCancel], [WithDeadline],
// [WithTimeout], or [WithValue]. When a Context is canceled, all
// Contexts derived from it are also canceled.
//
// The [WithCancel], [WithDeadline], and [WithTimeout] functions take a
// Context (the parent) and return a derived Context (the child) and a
// [CancelFunc]. Calling the CancelFunc cancels the child and its
// children, removes the parent's reference to the child, and stops
// any associated timers. Failing to call the CancelFunc leaks the
// child and its children until the parent is canceled or the timer
// fires. The go vet tool checks that CancelFuncs are used on all
// control-flow paths.
//
// The [WithCancelCause] function returns a [CancelCauseFunc], which
// takes an error and records it as the cancellation cause. Calling
// [Cause] on the canceled context or any of its children retrieves
// the cause. If no cause is specified, Cause(ctx) returns the same
// value as ctx.Err().
//
// Programs that use Contexts should follow these rules to keep interfaces
// consistent across packages and enable static analysis tools to check context
// propagation:
//
// Do not store Contexts inside a struct type; instead, pass a Context
// explicitly to each function that needs it. The Context should be the first
// parameter, typically named ctx:
//
//	func DoSomething(ctx context.Context, arg Arg) error {
//		// ... use ctx ...
//	}
//
// Do not pass a nil [Context], even if a function permits it. Pass [context.TODO]
// if you are unsure about which Context to use.
//
// Use context Values only for request-scoped data that transits processes and
// APIs, not for passing optional parameters to functions.
//
// The same Context may be passed to functions running in different goroutines;
// Contexts are safe for simultaneous use by multiple goroutines.
//
// See https://blog.golang.org/context for example code for a server that uses
// Contexts.

// If the context has already been canceled, CancelCauseFunc does not set the cause.
// For example, if childContext is derived from parentContext:
//   - if parentContext is canceled with cause1 before childContext is canceled with cause2,
//     then Cause(parentContext) == Cause(childContext) == cause1

// Example use:
//
//	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancelCause(parent)
//	cancel(myError)
//	ctx.Err() // returns context.Canceled
//	context.Cause(ctx) // returns myError

// The stop function does not wait for f to complete before returning.
// If the caller needs to know whether f is completed,
