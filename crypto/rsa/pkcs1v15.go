// DecryptPKCS1v15SessionKey returns an error if the ciphertext is the wrong
// length or if the ciphertext is greater than the public modulus. Otherwise, no
// error is returned. If the padding is valid, the resulting plaintext message
// is copied into key. Otherwise, key is unchanged. These alternatives occur in
// constant time. It is intended that the user of this function generate a
// random session key beforehand and continue the protocol with the resulting
// value.
//
// Note that if the session key is too small then it may be possible for an
// attacker to brute-force it. If they can do that then they can learn whether a
// random value was used (because it'll be different for the same ciphertext)
// and thus whether the padding was correct. This also defeats the point of this
// function. Using at least a 16-byte key will protect against this attack.
//
// This method implements protections against Bleichenbacher chosen ciphertext
// attacks [0] described in RFC 3218 Section 2.3.2 [1]. While these protections
// make a Bleichenbacher attack significantly more difficult, the protections
// are only effective if the rest of the protocol which uses
// DecryptPKCS1v15SessionKey is designed with these considerations in mind. In
// particular, if any subsequent operations which use the decrypted session key
// leak any information about the key (e.g. whether it is a static or random
// key) then the mitigations are defeated. This method must be used extremely
// carefully, and typically should only be used when absolutely necessary for
// compatibility with an existing protocol (such as TLS) that is designed with
// these properties in mind.
