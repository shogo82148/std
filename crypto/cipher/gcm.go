// gcmAble is an interface implemented by ciphers that have a specific optimized
// implementation of GCM, like crypto/aes. NewGCM will check for this interface
// and return the specific AEAD if found.

// gcmFieldElement represents a value in GF(2¹²⁸). In order to reflect the GCM
// standard and make binary.BigEndian suitable for marshaling these values, the
// bits are stored in big endian order. For example:
//   the coefficient of x⁰ can be obtained by v.low >> 63.
//   the coefficient of x⁶³ can be obtained by v.low & 1.
//   the coefficient of x⁶⁴ can be obtained by v.high >> 63.
//   the coefficient of x¹²⁷ can be obtained by v.high & 1.

// gcm represents a Galois Counter Mode with a specific key. See
// https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/proposedmodes/gcm/gcm-revised-spec.pdf

// NewGCM returns the given 128-bit, block cipher wrapped in Galois Counter Mode
// with the standard nonce length.
//
// In general, the GHASH operation performed by this implementation of GCM is not constant-time.
// An exception is when the underlying Block was created by aes.NewCipher
// on systems with hardware support for AES. See the crypto/aes package documentation for details.

// NewGCM, which is faster and more resistant to misuse.
