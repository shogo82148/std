package cipher

// NewGCM returns the given 128-bit, block cipher wrapped in Galois Counter Mode
// with the standard nonce length.
//
// In general, the GHASH operation performed by this implementation of GCM is not constant-time.
// An exception is when the underlying [Block] was created by aes.NewCipher
// on systems with hardware support for AES. See the [crypto/aes] package documentation for details.
func NewGCM(cipher Block) (AEAD, error)

// NewGCMWithNonceSize returns the given 128-bit, block cipher wrapped in Galois
// Counter Mode, which accepts nonces of the given length. The length must not
// be zero.
//
// Only use this function if you require compatibility with an existing
// cryptosystem that uses non-standard nonce lengths. All other users should use
// [NewGCM], which is faster and more resistant to misuse.
func NewGCMWithNonceSize(cipher Block, size int) (AEAD, error)

// NewGCMWithTagSize returns the given 128-bit, block cipher wrapped in Galois
// Counter Mode, which generates tags with the given length.
//
// Tag sizes between 12 and 16 bytes are allowed.
//
// Only use this function if you require compatibility with an existing
// cryptosystem that uses non-standard tag lengths. All other users should use
// [NewGCM], which is more resistant to misuse.
func NewGCMWithTagSize(cipher Block, tagSize int) (AEAD, error)

// NewGCMWithRandomNonce returns the given cipher wrapped in Galois Counter
// Mode, with randomly-generated nonces. The cipher must have been created by
// [aes.NewCipher].
//
// It generates a random 96-bit nonce, which is prepended to the ciphertext by Seal,
// and is extracted from the ciphertext by Open. The NonceSize of the AEAD is zero,
// while the Overhead is 28 bytes (the combination of nonce size and tag size).
//
// A given key MUST NOT be used to encrypt more than 2^32 messages, to limit the
// risk of a random nonce collision to negligible levels.
