// Counter (CTR) mode.

// CTR converts a block cipher into a stream cipher by
// repeatedly encrypting an incrementing counter and
// xoring the resulting stream of data with the input.

// See NIST SP 800-38A, pp 13-15

// ctrAble is an interface implemented by ciphers that have a specific optimized
// implementation of CTR, like crypto/aes. NewCTR will check for this interface
// and return the specific Stream if found.

// NewCTR returns a Stream which encrypts/decrypts using the given Block in
// counter mode. The length of iv must be the same as the Block's block size.
