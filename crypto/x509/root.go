package x509

// SetFallbackRoots sets the roots to use during certificate verification, if no
// custom roots are specified and a platform verifier or a system certificate
// pool is not available (for instance in a container which does not have a root
// certificate bundle). SetFallbackRoots will panic if roots is nil.
//
// SetFallbackRoots may only be called once, if called multiple times it will
// panic.
//
// The fallback behavior can be forced on all platforms, even when there is a
// system certificate pool, by setting GODEBUG=x509usefallbackroots=1 (note that
// on Windows and macOS this will disable usage of the platform verification
// APIs and cause the pure Go verifier to be used). Setting
// x509usefallbackroots=1 without calling SetFallbackRoots has no effect.
