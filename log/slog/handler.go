// A Handler handles log records produced by a Logger.
//
// A typical handler may print log records to standard error,
// or write them to a file or database, or perhaps augment them
// with additional attributes and pass them on to another handler.
//
// Any of the Handler's methods may be called concurrently with itself
// or with other methods. It is the responsibility of the Handler to
// manage this concurrency.
//
// Users of the slog package should not invoke Handler methods directly.
// They should use the methods of [Logger] instead.

	// of the log statement and add a SourceKey attribute to the output.

	// Level reports the minimum record level that will be logged.
	// The handler discards records with lower levels.
	// If Level is nil, the handler assumes LevelInfo.
	// The handler calls Level.Level for each record processed;
	// to adjust the minimum level dynamically, use a LevelVar.

	// ReplaceAttr is called to rewrite each non-group attribute before it is logged.
	// The attribute's value has been resolved (see [Value.Resolve]).
	// If ReplaceAttr returns a zero Attr, the attribute is discarded.
	//
	// The built-in attributes with keys "time", "level", "source", and "msg"
	// are passed to this function, except that time is omitted
	// if zero, and source is omitted if AddSource is false.
	//
	// The first argument is a list of currently open groups that contain the
	// Attr. It must not be retained or modified. ReplaceAttr is never called
	// for Group attributes, only their contents. For example, the attribute
	// list
	//
	//     Int("a", 1), Group("g", Int("b", 2)), Int("c", 3)
	//
	// results in consecutive calls to ReplaceAttr with the following arguments:
	//
	//     nil, Int("a", 1)
	//     []string{"g"}, Int("b", 2)
	//     nil, Int("c", 3)
	//
	// ReplaceAttr can be used to change the default keys of the built-in
	// attributes, convert types (for example, to replace a `time.Time` with the
	// integer seconds since the Unix epoch), sanitize personal information, or
	// remove attributes from the output.
