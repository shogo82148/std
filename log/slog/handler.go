// A Handler handles log records produced by a Logger.
//
// A typical handler may print log records to standard error,
// or write them to a file or database, or perhaps augment them
// with additional attributes and pass them on to another handler.
//
// Any of the Handler's methods may be called concurrently with itself
// or with other methods. It is the responsibility of the Handler to
// manage this concurrency.
//
// Users of the slog package should not invoke Handler methods directly.
// They should use the methods of [Logger] instead.
type Handler interface {
	// Enabled reports whether the handler handles records at the given level.
	// The handler ignores records whose level is lower.
	// It is called early, before any arguments are processed,
	// to save effort if the log event should be discarded.
	// If called from a Logger method, the first argument is the context
	// passed to that method, or context.Background() if nil was passed
	// or the method does not take a context.
	// The context is passed so Enabled can use its values
	// to make a decision.
	Enabled(context.Context, Level) bool

	// Handle handles the Record.
	// It will only be called when Enabled returns true.
	// The Context argument is as for Enabled.
	// It is present solely to provide Handlers access to the context's values.
	// Canceling the context should not affect record processing.
	// (Among other things, log messages may be necessary to debug a
	// cancellation-related problem.)
	//
	// Handle methods that produce output should observe the following rules:
	//   - If r.Time is the zero time, ignore the time.
	//   - If r.PC is zero, ignore it.
	//   - Attr's values should be resolved.
	//   - If an Attr's key and value are both the zero value, ignore the Attr.
	//     This can be tested with attr.Equal(Attr{}).
	//   - If a group's key is empty, inline the group's Attrs.
	//   - If a group has no Attrs (even if it has a non-empty key),
	//     ignore it.

	// WithAttrs returns a new Handler whose attributes consist of
	// both the receiver's attributes and the arguments.
	// The Handler owns the slice: it may retain, modify or discard it.

	// WithGroup returns a new Handler with the given group appended to
	// the receiver's existing groups.
	// The keys of all subsequent attributes, whether added by With or in a
	// Record, should be qualified by the sequence of group names.
	//
	// How this qualification happens is up to the Handler, so long as
	// this Handler's attribute keys differ from those of another Handler
	// with a different sequence of group names.
	//
	// A Handler should treat WithGroup as starting a Group of Attrs that ends
	// at the end of the log event. That is,
	//
	//     logger.WithGroup("s").LogAttrs(level, msg, slog.Int("a", 1), slog.Int("b", 2))
	//
	// should behave like
	//
	//     logger.LogAttrs(level, msg, slog.Group("s", slog.Int("a", 1), slog.Int("b", 2)))
	//
	// If the name is empty, WithGroup returns the receiver.

	// Level reports the minimum record level that will be logged.

	// ReplaceAttr is called to rewrite each non-group attribute before it is logged.
	// The attribute's value has been resolved (see [Value.Resolve]).
	// If ReplaceAttr returns a zero Attr, the attribute is discarded.
	//
	// The built-in attributes with keys "time", "level", "source", and "msg"
	// are passed to this function, except that time is omitted
	// if zero, and source is omitted if AddSource is false.
	//
	// The first argument is a list of currently open groups that contain the
	// Attr. It must not be retained or modified. ReplaceAttr is never called
	// for Group attributes, only their contents. For example, the attribute
	// list
	//
	//     Int("a", 1), Group("g", Int("b", 2)), Int("c", 3)
	//
	// results in consecutive calls to ReplaceAttr with the following arguments:
	//
	//     nil, Int("a", 1)
	//     []string{"g"}, Int("b", 2)
	//     nil, Int("c", 3)
	//
	// ReplaceAttr can be used to change the default keys of the built-in
	// attributes, convert types (for example, to replace a `time.Time` with the
	// integer seconds since the Unix epoch), sanitize personal information, or
	// remove attributes from the output.
