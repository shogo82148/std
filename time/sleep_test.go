// Go runtime uses different Windows timers for time.Now and sleeping.
// These can tick at different frequencies and can arrive out of sync.
// The effect can be seen, for example, as time.Sleep(100ms) is actually
// shorter then 100ms when measured as difference between time.Now before and
// after time.Sleep call. This was observed on Windows XP SP3 (windows/386).
// windowsInaccuracy is to ignore such errors.
