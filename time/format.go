package time

// These are predefined layouts for use in Time.Format and time.Parse.
// The reference time used in the layouts is the specific time:
//
//	Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006
//
// which is Unix time 1136239445. Since MST is GMT-0700,
// the reference time can be thought of as
//
//	01/02 03:04:05PM '06 -0700
//
// To define your own format, write down what the reference time would look
// like formatted your way; see the values of constants like ANSIC,
// StampMicro or Kitchen for examples. The model is to demonstrate what the
// reference time looks like so that the Format and Parse methods can apply
// the same transformation to a general time value.
//
// Some valid layouts are invalid time values for time.Parse, due to formats
// such as _ for space padding and Z for zone information.
//
// Within the format string, an underscore _ represents a space that may be
// replaced by a digit if the following number (a day) has two digits; for
// compatibility with fixed-width Unix time formats.
//
// A decimal point followed by one or more zeros represents a fractional
// second, printed to the given number of decimal places. A decimal point
// followed by one or more nines represents a fractional second, printed to
// the given number of decimal places, with trailing zeros removed.
// When parsing (only), the input may contain a fractional second
// field immediately after the seconds field, even if the layout does not
// signify its presence. In that case a decimal point followed by a maximal
// series of digits is parsed as a fractional second.
//
// Numeric time zone offsets format as follows:
//
//	-0700  ±hhmm
//	-07:00 ±hh:mm
//	-07    ±hh
//
// Replacing the sign in the format with a Z triggers
// the ISO 8601 behavior of printing Z instead of an
// offset for the UTC zone. Thus:
//
//	Z0700  Z or ±hhmm
//	Z07:00 Z or ±hh:mm
//	Z07    Z or ±hh
//
// The recognized day of week formats are "Mon" and "Monday".
// The recognized month formats are "Jan" and "January".
//
// The formats 2, _2, and 02 are unpadded, space-padded, and zero-padded
// day of month. The formats __2 and 002 are space-padded and zero-padded
// three-character day of year; there is no unpadded day of year format.
//
// Text in the format string that is not recognized as part of the reference
// time is echoed verbatim during Format and expected to appear verbatim
// in the input to Parse.
//
// The executable example for Time.Format demonstrates the working
// of the layout string in detail and is a good reference.
//
// Note that the RFC822, RFC850, and RFC1123 formats should be applied
// only to local times. Applying them to UTC times will use "UTC" as the
// time zone abbreviation, while strictly speaking those RFCs require the
// use of "GMT" in that case.
// In general RFC1123Z should be used instead of RFC1123 for servers
// that insist on that format, and RFC3339 should be preferred for new protocols.
// RFC3339, RFC822, RFC822Z, RFC1123, and RFC1123Z are useful for formatting;
// when used with time.Parse they do not accept all the time formats
// permitted by the RFCs.
// The RFC3339Nano format removes trailing zeros from the seconds field
// and thus may not sort correctly once formatted.

//

// Predefined layouts ANSIC, UnixDate, RFC3339 and others describe standard

//
// Elements omitted from the value are assumed to be zero or, when
// zero is impossible, one, so parsing "3:04pm" returns the time
// corresponding to Jan 1, year 0, 15:04:00 UTC (note that because the year is
// 0, this time is before the zero Time).
// Years must be in the range 0000..9999. The day of the week is checked
// for syntax but it is otherwise ignored.
//
// For layouts specifying the two-digit year 06, a value NN >= 69 will be treated
// as 19NN and a value NN < 69 will be treated as 20NN.
//
// In the absence of a time zone indicator, Parse returns a time in UTC.
//
// When parsing a time with a zone offset like -0700, if the offset corresponds
// to a time zone used by the current location (Local), then Parse uses that
// location and zone in the returned time. Otherwise it records the time as
// being in a fabricated location with time fixed at the given zone offset.
//
// When parsing a time with a zone abbreviation like MST, if the zone abbreviation
// has a defined offset in the current location, then that offset is used.
// The zone abbreviation "UTC" is recognized as UTC regardless of location.
// If the zone abbreviation is unknown, Parse records the time as being
// in a fabricated location with the given zone abbreviation and a zero offset.
// This choice means that such a time can be parsed and reformatted with the
// same layout losslessly, but the exact instant used in the representation will
// differ by the actual zone offset. To avoid such problems, prefer time layouts
// that use a numeric zone offset, or use ParseInLocation.
func Parse(layout, value string) (Time, error)

// ParseInLocation is like Parse but differs in two important ways.
// First, in the absence of time zone information, Parse interprets a time as UTC;
// ParseInLocation interprets the time as in the given location.
// Second, when given a zone offset or abbreviation, Parse tries to match it
// against the Local location; ParseInLocation uses the given location.
