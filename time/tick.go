// A Ticker holds a channel that delivers “ticks” of a clock
// at intervals.
type Ticker struct {
	C <-chan Time
	r runtimeTimer
}

// NewTicker returns a new Ticker containing a channel that will send
// the current time on the channel after each tick. The period of the
// ticks is specified by the duration argument. The ticker will adjust
// the time interval or drop ticks to make up for slow receivers.
// The duration d must be greater than zero; if not, NewTicker will
// panic. Stop the ticker to release associated resources.
func NewTicker(d Duration) *Ticker

// Stop turns off a ticker. After Stop, no more ticks will be sent.
// Stop does not close the channel, to prevent a concurrent goroutine
// reading from the channel from seeing an erroneous "tick".
func (t *Ticker) Stop()

// Reset stops a ticker and resets its period to the specified duration.
// The next tick will arrive after the new period elapses. The duration d
// must be greater than zero; if not, Reset will panic.
func (t *Ticker) Reset(d Duration)

// Tick is a convenience wrapper for NewTicker providing access to the ticking
// channel only. While Tick is useful for clients that have no need to shut down
// the Ticker, be aware that without a way to shut it down the underlying
// Ticker cannot be recovered by the garbage collector; it "leaks".
// Unlike NewTicker, Tick will return nil if d <= 0.
func Tick(d Duration) <-chan Time
