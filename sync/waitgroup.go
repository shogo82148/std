// A WaitGroup is a counting semaphore typically used to wait
// for a group of goroutines or tasks to finish.
//
// Typically, a main goroutine will start tasks, each in a new
// goroutine, by calling [WaitGroup.Go] and then wait for all tasks to
// complete by calling [WaitGroup.Wait]. For example:
//
//	var wg sync.WaitGroup
//	wg.Go(task1)
//	wg.Go(task2)
//	wg.Wait()
//
// A WaitGroup may also be used for tracking tasks without using Go to
// start new goroutines by using [WaitGroup.Add] and [WaitGroup.Done].
//
// The previous example can be rewritten using explicitly created
// goroutines along with Add and Done:
//
//	var wg sync.WaitGroup
//	wg.Add(1)
//	go func() {
//		defer wg.Done()
//		task1()
//	}()
//	wg.Add(1)
//	go func() {
//		defer wg.Done()
//		task2()
//	}()
//	wg.Wait()
//
// This pattern is common in code that predates [WaitGroup.Go].
//
// A WaitGroup must not be copied after first use.
type WaitGroup struct {
	noCopy noCopy

	state atomic.Uint64
	sema  uint32
}

// Add adds delta, which may be negative, to the [WaitGroup] task counter.
// If the counter becomes zero, all goroutines blocked on [WaitGroup.Wait] are released.
// If the counter goes negative, Add panics.
//
// Callers should prefer [WaitGroup.Go].
//
// Note that calls with a positive delta that occur when the counter is zero
// must happen before a Wait. Calls with a negative delta, or calls with a
// positive delta that start when the counter is greater than zero, may happen
// at any time.
// Typically this means the calls to Add should execute before the statement
// creating the goroutine or other event to be waited for.
// If a WaitGroup is reused to wait for several independent sets of events,
// new Add calls must happen after all previous Wait calls have returned.
// See the WaitGroup example.
func (wg *WaitGroup) Add(delta int)

// Done decrements the [WaitGroup] task counter by one.
// It is equivalent to Add(-1).
//
// Callers should prefer [WaitGroup.Go].
//
// In the terminology of [the Go memory model], a call to Done
// "synchronizes before" the return of any Wait call that it unblocks.
//

func (wg *WaitGroup) Done()

// Wait blocks until the [WaitGroup] task counter is zero.
func (wg *WaitGroup) Wait()

// Go calls f in a new goroutine and adds that task to the [WaitGroup].
// When f returns, the task is removed from the WaitGroup.
//
// If the WaitGroup is empty, Go must happen before a [WaitGroup.Wait].
// Typically, this simply means Go is called to start tasks before Wait is called.
// If the WaitGroup is not empty, Go may happen at any time.
// This means a goroutine started by Go may itself call Go.
// If a WaitGroup is reused to wait for several independent sets of tasks,
// new Go calls must happen after all previous Wait calls have returned.
//
// In the terminology of [the Go memory model], the return from f
// "synchronizes before" the return of any Wait call that it unblocks.
