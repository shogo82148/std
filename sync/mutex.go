// A Mutex is a mutual exclusion lock.
// The zero value for a Mutex is an unlocked mutex.

// Lock locks m.
// If the lock is already in use, the calling goroutine
// blocks until the mutex is available.

// Unlock unlocks m.
// It is a run-time error if m is not locked on entry to Unlock.
//
// A locked Mutex is not associated with a particular goroutine.
// It is allowed for one goroutine to lock a Mutex and then
// arrange for another goroutine to unlock it.
