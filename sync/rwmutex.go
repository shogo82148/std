// An RWMutex is a reader/writer mutual exclusion lock.
// The lock can be held by an arbitrary number of readers or a single writer.
// The zero value for a RWMutex is an unlocked mutex.
//
// An RWMutex must not be copied after first use.
//
// If a goroutine holds a RWMutex for reading and another goroutine might
// call Lock, no goroutine should expect to be able to acquire a read lock
// until the initial read lock is released. In particular, this prohibits
// recursive read locking. This is to ensure that the lock eventually becomes
// available; a blocked Lock call excludes new readers from acquiring the
// lock.
type RWMutex struct {
	w           Mutex
	writerSem   uint32
	readerSem   uint32
	readerCount int32
	readerWait  int32
}

// RLock locks rw for reading.
//
// It should not be used for recursive read locking; a blocked Lock
// call excludes new readers from acquiring the lock. See the
// documentation on the RWMutex type.
func (rw *RWMutex) RLock()

// RUnlock undoes a single RLock call;
// it does not affect other simultaneous readers.
// It is a run-time error if rw is not locked for reading
// on entry to RUnlock.
func (rw *RWMutex) RUnlock()

// Lock locks rw for writing.
// If the lock is already locked for reading or writing,
// Lock blocks until the lock is available.
func (rw *RWMutex) Lock()

// Unlock unlocks rw for writing. It is a run-time error if rw is
// not locked for writing on entry to Unlock.
//
// As with Mutexes, a locked RWMutex is not associated with a particular
// goroutine. One goroutine may RLock (Lock) an RWMutex and then
// arrange for another goroutine to RUnlock (Unlock) it.
func (rw *RWMutex) Unlock()

// RLocker returns a Locker interface that implements
// the Lock and Unlock methods by calling rw.RLock and rw.RUnlock.
func (rw *RWMutex) RLocker() Locker
