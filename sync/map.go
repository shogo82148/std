// Map is like a Go map[interface{}]interface{} but is safe for concurrent use
// by multiple goroutines without additional locking or coordination.
// Loads, stores, and deletes run in amortized constant time.
//
// The Map type is specialized. Most code should use a plain Go map instead,
// with separate locking or coordination, for better type safety and to make it
// easier to maintain other invariants along with the map content.
//
// The Map type is optimized for two common use cases: (1) when the entry for a given
// key is only ever written once but read many times, as in caches that only grow,
// or (2) when multiple goroutines read, write, and overwrite entries for disjoint
// sets of keys. In these two cases, use of a Map may significantly reduce lock
// contention compared to a Go map paired with a separate Mutex or RWMutex.
//
// The zero Map is empty and ready for use. A Map must not be copied after first use.

// readOnly is an immutable struct stored atomically in the Map.read field.

// expunged is an arbitrary pointer that marks entries which have been deleted
// from the dirty map.

// An entry is a slot in the map corresponding to a particular key.

// Load returns the value stored in the map for a key, or nil if no
// value is present.
// The ok result indicates whether value was found in the map.

// Store sets the value for a key.
func (m *Map) Store(key, value any)

// LoadOrStore returns the existing value for the key if present.
// Otherwise, it stores and returns the given value.
// The loaded result is true if the value was loaded, false if stored.
func (m *Map) LoadOrStore(key, value any) (actual any, loaded bool)

// LoadAndDelete deletes the value for a key, returning the previous value if any.
// The loaded result reports whether the key was present.

// Delete deletes the value for a key.
func (m *Map) Delete(key any)

// Range calls f sequentially for each key and value present in the map.
// If f returns false, range stops the iteration.
//
// Range does not necessarily correspond to any consistent snapshot of the Map's
// contents: no key will be visited more than once, but if the value for any key
// is stored or deleted concurrently (including by f), Range may reflect any
// mapping for that key from any point during the Range call. Range does not
// block other methods on the receiver; even f itself may call any method on m.
//
// Range may be O(N) with the number of elements in the map even if f returns
// false after a constant number of calls.
