// Cond implements a condition variable, a rendezvous point
// for goroutines waiting for or announcing the occurrence
// of an event.
//
// Each Cond has an associated Locker L (often a *Mutex or *RWMutex),
// which must be held when changing the condition and
// when calling the Wait method.
//
// A Cond can be created as part of other structures.
// A Cond must not be copied after first use.

// NewCond returns a new Cond with Locker l.
func NewCond(l Locker) *Cond

// Wait atomically unlocks c.L and suspends execution
// of the calling goroutine. After later resuming execution,
// Wait locks c.L before returning. Unlike in other systems,
// Wait cannot return unless awoken by Broadcast or Signal.
//
// Because c.L is not locked when Wait first resumes, the caller
// typically cannot assume that the condition is true when
// Wait returns. Instead, the caller should Wait in a loop:
//
//	c.L.Lock()
//	for !condition() {
//	    c.Wait()
//	}
//	... make use of condition ...
//	c.L.Unlock()
func (c *Cond) Wait()

// Signal wakes one goroutine waiting on c, if there is any.
//
// It is allowed but not required for the caller to hold c.L
// during the call.
func (c *Cond) Signal()

// Broadcast wakes all goroutines waiting on c.
//
// It is allowed but not required for the caller to hold c.L
// during the call.
func (c *Cond) Broadcast()

// copyChecker holds back pointer to itself to detect object copying.

// noCopy may be embedded into structs which must not be copied
// after the first use.
