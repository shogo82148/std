// Implementations should return a buffer that is safe
// for the caller to retain and potentially mutate.
//
// Implementations must not return [errors.ErrUnsupported].
//
// If the returned error is a [SemanticError], then unpopulated fields
// of the error may be populated by [json] with additional context.
// Errors of other types are wrapped within a [SemanticError].
//
// Implementations should assume [Deterministic] is true and return

// MarshalerTo is implemented by types that can marshal themselves.
// It is recommended that types implement MarshalerTo instead of [Marshaler]
// since it is both more performant and more flexible.
// If a type implements both Marshaler and MarshalerTo,
// then MarshalerTo takes precedence. In such a case, both implementations
// should aim to have equivalent behavior for the default marshal options.
//
// The implementation must write only one JSON value to the Encoder.
// Alternatively, it may return [errors.ErrUnsupported] without mutating
// the Encoder. The "json" package calling the method will
// use the next available JSON representation for the receiver type,
// as described in [Marshal].
// Implementations must not retain the pointer to [jsontext.Encoder].
//
// If the returned error is a [SemanticError], then unpopulated fields
// of the error may be populated by [json] with additional context.
// Errors of other types are wrapped within a [SemanticError],
// except for IO errors.
//
// The MarshalJSONTo method should not be called directly as it may
// return sentinel errors that need special handling.
// Users should instead call [MarshalEncode], which handles such cases.
//
// Implementations should inspect the marshal options from
// [jsontext.Encoder.Options] and adjust behavior to respect the options as
// necessary.
//
// The following options may be relevant to MarshalerTo implementations:
//
//   - [Deterministic]: if the implementation may produce non-deterministic output
//   - [StringifyNumbers]: if the type is represented as a JSON number
//
// Several options, such as [FormatNilSliceAsNull], apply only to native Go
// types. Thus, these options are typically not directly relevant to
// MarshalerTo implementations. However, types representing a composite type
// should marshal contained types using [MarshalEncode] to ensure these options
// apply to the contained types. Similarly, [WithMarshalers] may influence
// marshaling of any contained type within a composite type.
//
// All other options are automatically handled outside of the MarshalerTo
// implementation, and thus are not relevant to implementations.
