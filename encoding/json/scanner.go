func (e *SyntaxError) Error() string

// A scanner is a JSON scanning state machine.
// Callers call scan.reset() and then pass bytes in one at a time
// by calling scan.step(&scan, c) for each byte.
// The return value, referred to as an opcode, tells the
// caller about significant parsing events like beginning
// and ending literals, objects, and arrays, so that the
// caller can follow along if it wishes.
// The return value scanEnd indicates that a single top-level
// JSON value has been completed, *before* the byte that
// just got passed in.  (The indication must be delayed in order
// to recognize the end of numbers: is 123 a whole value or
// the beginning of 12345e+6?).

// These values are returned by the state transition functions
// assigned to scanner.state and the method scanner.eof.
// They give details about the current state of the scan that
// callers might be interested to know about.
// It is okay to ignore the return value of any particular
// call to scanner.state: if one call returns scanError,
// every subsequent call will return scanError too.

// These values are stored in the parseState stack.
// They give the current state of a composite value
// being scanned. If the parser is inside a nested value
// the parseState describes the nested state, outermost at entry 0.
