package xml

// Unmarshal parses the XML-encoded data and stores the result in
// the value pointed to by v, which must be an arbitrary struct,
// slice, or string. Well-formed data that does not fit into v is
// discarded.
//
// Because Unmarshal uses the reflect package, it can only assign
// to exported (upper case) fields.  Unmarshal uses a case-sensitive
// comparison to match XML element names to tag values and struct
// field names.
//
// Unmarshal maps an XML element to a struct using the following rules.
// In the rules, the tag of a field refers to the value associated with the
// key 'xml' in the struct field's tag (see the example above).
//
//   - If the struct has a field of type []byte or string with tag
//     ",innerxml", Unmarshal accumulates the raw XML nested inside the
//     element in that field.  The rest of the rules still apply.
//
//   - If the struct has a field named XMLName of type xml.Name,
//     Unmarshal records the element name in that field.
//
//   - If the XMLName field has an associated tag of the form
//     "name" or "namespace-URL name", the XML element must have
//     the given name (and, optionally, name space) or else Unmarshal
//     returns an error.
//
//   - If the XML element has an attribute whose name matches a
//     struct field name with an associated tag containing ",attr" or
//     the explicit name in a struct field tag of the form "name,attr",
//     Unmarshal records the attribute value in that field.
//
//   - If the XML element contains character data, that data is
//     accumulated in the first struct field that has tag "chardata".
//     The struct field may have type []byte or string.
//     If there is no such field, the character data is discarded.
//
//   - If the XML element contains comments, they are accumulated in
//     the first struct field that has tag ",comments".  The struct
//     field may have type []byte or string.  If there is no such
//     field, the comments are discarded.
//
//   - If the XML element contains a sub-element whose name matches
//     the prefix of a tag formatted as "a" or "a>b>c", unmarshal
//     will descend into the XML structure looking for elements with the
//     given names, and will map the innermost elements to that struct
//     field. A tag starting with ">" is equivalent to one starting
//     with the field name followed by ">".
//
//   - If the XML element contains a sub-element whose name matches
//     a struct field's XMLName tag and the struct field has no
//     explicit name tag as per the previous rule, unmarshal maps
//     the sub-element to that struct field.
//
//   - If the XML element contains a sub-element whose name matches a
//     field without any mode flags (",attr", ",chardata", etc), Unmarshal
//     maps the sub-element to that struct field.
//
//   - If the XML element contains a sub-element that hasn't matched any
//     of the above rules and the struct has a field with tag ",any",
//     unmarshal maps the sub-element to that struct field.
//
//   - An anonymous struct field is handled as if the fields of its
//     value were part of the outer struct.
//
//   - A struct field with tag "-" is never unmarshalled into.
//
// Unmarshal maps an XML element to a string or []byte by saving the
// concatenation of that element's character data in the string or
// []byte. The saved []byte is never nil.
//
// Unmarshal maps an attribute value to a string or []byte by saving
// the value in the string or slice.
//
// Unmarshal maps an XML element to a slice by extending the length of
// the slice and mapping the element to the newly created value.
//
// Unmarshal maps an XML element or attribute value to a bool by
// setting it to the boolean value represented by the string.
//
// Unmarshal maps an XML element or attribute value to an integer or
// floating-point field by setting the field to the result of
// interpreting the string value in decimal.  There is no check for
// overflow.
//
// Unmarshal maps an XML element to an xml.Name by recording the
// element name.
//
// Unmarshal maps an XML element to a pointer by setting the pointer
// to a freshly allocated value and then mapping the element to that value.
func Unmarshal(data []byte, v interface{}) error

// Decode works like xml.Unmarshal, except it reads the decoder
// stream to find the start element.
func (d *Decoder) Decode(v interface{}) error

// DecodeElement works like xml.Unmarshal except that it takes
// a pointer to the start XML element to decode into v.
// It is useful when a client reads some raw XML tokens itself
// but also wants to defer to Unmarshal for some elements.
func (d *Decoder) DecodeElement(v interface{}, start *StartElement) error

// An UnmarshalError represents an error in the unmarshalling process.
type UnmarshalError string

func (e UnmarshalError) Error() string

// Skip reads tokens until it has consumed the end element
// matching the most recent start element already consumed.
// It recurs if it encounters a start element, so it can be used to
// skip nested structures.
// It returns nil if it finds an end element matching the start
// element; otherwise it returns an error describing the problem.
func (d *Decoder) Skip() error
