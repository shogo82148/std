package pods

// Pod encapsulates a set of files emitted during the executions of a
// coverage-instrumented binary. Each pod contains a single meta-data
// file, and then 0 or more counter data files that refer to that
// meta-data file. Pods are intended to simplify processing of
// coverage output files in the case where we have several coverage
// output directories containing output files derived from more
// than one instrumented executable. In the case where the files that
// make up a pod are spread out across multiple directories, each
// element of the "Origins" field below will be populated with the
// index of the originating directory for the corresponding counter
// data file (within the slice of input dirs handed to CollectPods).
// The ProcessIDs field will be populated with the process ID of each
// data file in the CounterDataFiles slice.
type Pod struct {
	MetaFile         string
	CounterDataFiles []string
	Origins          []int
	ProcessIDs       []int
}

// CollectPods visits the files contained within the directories in
// the list 'dirs', collects any coverage-related files, partitions
// them into pods, and returns a list of the pods to the caller, along
// with an error if something went wrong during directory/file
// reading.
//
// CollectPods skips over any file that is not related to coverage
// (e.g. avoids looking at things that are not meta-data files or
// counter-data files). CollectPods also skips over 'orphaned' counter
// data files (e.g. counter data files for which we can't find the
// corresponding meta-data file). If "warn" is true, CollectPods will
// issue warnings to stderr when it encounters non-fatal problems (for
// orphans or a directory with no meta-data files).
func CollectPods(dirs []string, warn bool) ([]Pod, error)

// CollectPodsFromFiles functions the same as "CollectPods" but
// operates on an explicit list of files instead of a directory.
func CollectPodsFromFiles(files []string, warn bool) []Pod
