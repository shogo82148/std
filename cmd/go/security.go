// Checking of compiler and linker flags.
// We must avoid flags like -fplugin=, which can allow
// arbitrary code execution during the build.
// Do not make changes here without carefully
// considering the implications.
// (That's why the code is isolated in a file named security.go.)
//
// Note that -Wl,foo means split foo on commas and pass to
// the linker, so that -Wl,-foo,bar means pass -foo bar to
// the linker. Similarly -Wa,foo for the assembler and so on.
// If any of these are permitted, the wildcard portion must
// disallow commas.
//
// Note also that GNU binutils accept any argument @foo
// as meaning "read more flags from the file foo", so we must
// guard against any command-line argument beginning with @,
// even things like "-I @foo".
// We use load.SafeArg (which is even more conservative)
// to reject these.
//
// Even worse, gcc -I@foo (one arg) turns into cc1 -I @foo (two args),
// so although gcc doesn't expand the @foo, cc1 will.
// So out of paranoia, we reject @ at the beginning of every
// flag argument that might be split into its own argument.
