var CmdVet = &base.Command{

Vet runs the Go vet tool (cmd/vet) on the named packages
and reports diagnostics.

It supports these flags:

  -c int
	display offending line with this many lines of context (default -1)
  -json
	emit JSON output
  -fix
	instead of printing each diagnostic, apply its first fix (if any)
  -diff
	instead of applying each fix, print the patch as a unified diff

The -vettool=prog flag selects a different analysis tool with
alternative or additional checks. For example, the 'shadow' analyzer
can be built and run using these commands:

  go install golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/shadow/cmd/shadow@latest
  go vet -vettool=$(which shadow)

Alternative vet tools should be built atop golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/unitchecker,
which handles the interaction with go vet.

For more about specifying packages, see 'go help packages'.
For a list of checkers and their flags, see 'go tool vet help'.
For details of a specific checker such as 'printf', see 'go tool vet help printf'.

The build flags supported by go vet are those that control package resolution
and execution, such as -C, -n, -x, -v, -tags, and -toolexec.
For more about these flags, see 'go help build'.

var CmdFix = &base.Command{

Fix runs the Go fix tool (cmd/vet) on the named packages
and applies suggested fixes.

It supports these flags:

  -diff
	instead of applying each fix, print the patch as a unified diff

The -fixtool=prog flag selects a different analysis tool with
alternative or additional fixes; see the documentation for go vet's
-vettool flag for details.

For more about specifying packages, see 'go help packages'.

For a list of fixers and their flags, see 'go tool fix help'.

For details of a specific fixer such as 'hostport',
see 'go tool fix help hostport'.

The build flags supported by go fix are those that control package resolution
and execution, such as -C, -n, -x, -v, -tags, and -toolexec.
For more about these flags, see 'go help build'.
