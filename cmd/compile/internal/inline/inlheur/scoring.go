// ScoreCalls assigns numeric scores to each of the callsites in
// function 'fn'; the lower the score, the more helpful we think it
// will be to inline.
//
// Unlike a lot of the other inline heuristics machinery, callsite
// scoring can't be done as part of the CanInline call for a function,
// due to fact that we may be working on a non-trivial SCC. So for
// example with this SCC:
//
//	func foo(x int) {           func bar(x int, f func()) {
//	  if x != 0 {                  f()
//	    bar(x, func(){})           foo(x-1)
//	  }                         }
//	}
//
// We don't want to perform scoring for the 'foo' call in "bar" until
// after foo has been analyzed, but it's conceivable that CanInline
// might visit bar before foo for this SCC.

// ScoreCallsCleanup resets the state of the callsite cache
// once ScoreCalls is done with a function.

// DumpInlCallSiteScores is invoked by the inliner if the debug flag
// "-d=dumpinlcallsitescores" is set; it dumps out a human-readable
// summary of all (potentially) inlinable callsites in the package,
// along with info on call site scoring and the adjustments made to a
// given score. Here profile is the PGO profile in use (may be
// nil), budgetCallback is a callback that can be invoked to find out
// the original pre-adjustment hairyness limit for the function, and
// inlineHotMaxBudget is the constant of the same name used in the
// inliner. Sample output lines:
//
// Score  Adjustment  Status  Callee  CallerPos ScoreFlags
// 115    40          DEMOTED cmd/compile/internal/abi.(*ABIParamAssignment).Offset     expand_calls.go:1679:14|6       panicPathAdj

//
// In the dump above, "Score" is the final score calculated for the
// callsite, "Adjustment" is the amount added to or subtracted from
// the original hairyness estimate to form the score. "Status" shows
// whether anything changed with the site -- did the adjustment bump
// it down just below the threshold ("PROMOTED") or instead bump it
// above the threshold ("DEMOTED"); this will be blank ("---") if no
// threshold was crossed as a result of the heuristics. Note that
// "Status" also shows whether PGO was involved. "Callee" is the name
// of the function called, "CallerPos" is the position of the
// callsite, and "ScoreFlags" is a digest of the specific properties
// we used to make adjustments to callsite score via heuristics.
