// ScoreCalls assigns numeric scores to each of the callsites in
// function 'fn'; the lower the score, the more helpful we think it
// will be to inline.
//
// Unlike a lot of the other inline heuristics machinery, callsite
// scoring can't be done as part of the CanInline call for a function,
// due to fact that we may be working on a non-trivial SCC. So for
// example with this SCC:
//
//	func foo(x int) {           func bar(x int, f func()) {
//	  if x != 0 {                  f()
//	    bar(x, func(){})           foo(x-1)
//	  }                         }
//	}
//
// We don't want to perform scoring for the 'foo' call in "bar" until
// after foo has been analyzed, but it's conceivable that CanInline
// might visit bar before foo for this SCC.
