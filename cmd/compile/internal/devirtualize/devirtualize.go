// Package devirtualize implements two "devirtualization" optimization passes:
//
//   - "Static" devirtualization which replaces interface method calls with
//     direct concrete-type method calls where possible.
//   - "Profile-guided" devirtualization which replaces indirect calls with a
//     conditional direct call to the hottest concrete callee from a profile, as
//     well as a fallback using the original indirect call.
package devirtualize

// StaticCall devirtualizes the given call if possible when the concrete callee
// is available statically.
