// Addr2line is a minimal simulation of the GNU addr2line tool,
// just enough to support pprof.
//
// Usage:
//
//	go tool addr2line binary
//
// Addr2line reads hexadecimal addresses, one per line and with optional 0x prefix,
// from standard input. For each input address, addr2line prints two output lines,
// first the name of the function containing the address and second the file:line
// of the source code corresponding to that address.
//
// This tool is intended for use only by pprof; its interface may change or
// it may be deleted entirely in future releases.
