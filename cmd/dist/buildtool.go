// bootstrapDirs is a list of directories holding code that must be
// compiled with a Go 1.4 toolchain to produce the bootstrapTargets.
// All directories in this list are relative to and must be below $GOROOT/src/cmd.
// The list is assumed to have two kinds of entries: names without slashes,
// which are commands, and entries beginning with internal/, which are
// packages supporting the commands.
