// A MapFS is a simple in-memory file system for use in tests,
// represented as a map from path names (arguments to Open)
// to information about the files, directories, or symbolic links they represent.
//
// The map need not include parent directories for files contained
// in the map; those will be synthesized if needed.
// But a directory can still be included by setting the [MapFile.Mode]'s [fs.ModeDir] bit;
// this may be necessary for detailed control over the directory's [fs.FileInfo]
// or to create an empty directory.
//
// File system operations read directly from the map,
// so that the file system can be changed by editing the map as needed.
// An implication is that file system operations must not run concurrently
// with changes to the map, which would be a race.
// Another implication is that opening or reading a directory requires
// iterating over the entire map, so a MapFS should typically be used with not more
// than a few hundred entries or directory reads.
