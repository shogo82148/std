// InternalFuzzTarget is an internal type but exported because it is
// cross-package; it is part of the implementation of the "go test" command.

// F is a type passed to fuzz tests.
//
// Fuzz tests run generated inputs against a provided fuzz target, which can
// find and report potential bugs in the code being tested.
//
// A fuzz test runs the seed corpus by default, which includes entries provided
// by (*F).Add and entries in the testdata/fuzz/<FuzzTestName> directory. After
// any necessary setup and calls to (*F).Add, the fuzz test must then call
// (*F).Fuzz to provide the fuzz target. See the testing package documentation
// for an example, and see the [F.Fuzz] and [F.Add] method documentation for
// details.
//
// *F methods can only be called before (*F).Fuzz. Once the test is
// executing the fuzz target, only (*T) methods can be used. The only *F methods
// that are allowed in the (*F).Fuzz function are (*F).Failed and (*F).Name.

// Add will add the arguments to the seed corpus for the fuzz test. This will be
// a no-op if called after or within the fuzz target, and args must match the
// arguments for the fuzz target.
func (f *F) Add(args ...any)

// Fuzz runs the fuzz function, ff, for fuzz testing. If ff fails for a set of
// arguments, those arguments will be added to the seed corpus.
//
// ff must be a function with no return value whose first argument is *T and
// whose remaining arguments are the types to be fuzzed.
// For example:
//
//	f.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, b []byte, i int) { ... })
//
// The following types are allowed: []byte, string, bool, byte, rune, float32,
// float64, int, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64.
// More types may be supported in the future.
//
// ff must not call any *F methods, e.g. (*F).Log, (*F).Error, (*F).Skip. Use
// the corresponding *T method instead. The only *F methods that are allowed in
// the (*F).Fuzz function are (*F).Failed and (*F).Name.
//
// This function should be fast and deterministic, and its behavior should not
// depend on shared state. No mutable input arguments, or pointers to them,
// should be retained between executions of the fuzz function, as the memory
// backing them may be mutated during a subsequent invocation. ff must not
// modify the underlying data of the arguments provided by the fuzzing engine.
//
// When fuzzing, F.Fuzz does not return until a problem is found, time runs out
// (set with -fuzztime), or the test process is interrupted by a signal. F.Fuzz
// should be called exactly once, unless F.Skip or [F.Fail] is called beforehand.
func (f *F) Fuzz(ff any)
