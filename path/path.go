package path

// Clean returns the shortest path name equivalent to path
// by purely lexical processing.  It applies the following rules
// iteratively until no further processing can be done:
//
//  1. Replace multiple slashes with a single slash.
//  2. Eliminate each . path name element (the current directory).
//  3. Eliminate each inner .. path name element (the parent directory)
//     along with the non-.. element that precedes it.
//  4. Eliminate .. elements that begin a rooted path:
//     that is, replace "/.." by "/" at the beginning of a path.
//
// The returned path ends in a slash only if it is the root "/".
//
// If the result of this process is an empty string, Clean
// returns the string ".".

func Clean(path string) string

// Split splits path immediately following the final slash.
// separating it into a directory and file name component.
// If there is no slash path, Split returns an empty dir and
// file set to path.
// The returned values have the property that path = dir+file.
func Split(path string) (dir, file string)

// Join joins any number of path elements into a single path, adding a
// separating slash if necessary. The result is Cleaned; in particular,
// all empty strings are ignored.
func Join(elem ...string) string

// Ext returns the file name extension used by path.
// The extension is the suffix beginning at the final dot
// in the final slash-separated element of path;
// it is empty if there is no dot.
func Ext(path string) string

// Base returns the last element of path.
// Trailing slashes are removed before extracting the last element.
// If the path is empty, Base returns ".".
// If the path consists entirely of slashes, Base returns "/".
func Base(path string) string

// IsAbs returns true if the path is absolute.
func IsAbs(path string) bool

// Dir returns all but the last element of path, typically the path's directory.
// The path is Cleaned and trailing slashes are removed before processing.
// If the path is empty, Dir returns ".".
// If the path consists entirely of slashes followed by non-slash bytes, Dir
// returns a single slash. In any other case, the returned path does not end in a
// slash.
func Dir(path string) string
