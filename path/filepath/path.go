// Clean returns the shortest path name equivalent to path
// by purely lexical processing. It applies the following rules
// iteratively until no further processing can be done:
//
//  1. Replace multiple Separator elements with a single one.
//  2. Eliminate each . path name element (the current directory).
//  3. Eliminate each inner .. path name element (the parent directory)
//     along with the non-.. element that precedes it.
//  4. Eliminate .. elements that begin a rooted path:
//     that is, replace "/.." by "/" at the beginning of a path,
//     assuming Separator is '/'.
//
// The returned path ends in a slash only if it represents a root directory,
// such as "/" on Unix or `C:\` on Windows.
//
// Finally, any occurrences of slash are replaced by Separator.
//
// If the result of this process is an empty string, Clean
// returns the string ".".

// SplitList splits a list of paths joined by the OS-specific ListSeparator,

// Split splits path immediately following the final Separator,

// Join joins any number of path elements into a single path, adding

// Rel returns a relative path that is lexically equivalent to targpath when
// joined to basepath with an intervening separator. That is,

// On success, the returned path will always be relative to basepath,
// even if basepath and targpath share no elements.

// knowing the current working directory would be necessary to compute it.

// SkipDir is used as a return value from WalkFuncs to indicate that

// WalkFunc is the type of the function called for each file or directory
// visited by Walk. The path argument contains the argument to Walk as a

// containing the file "a", the walk function will be called with argument
// "dir/a". The info argument is the os.FileInfo for the named path.
//
// If there was a problem walking to the file or directory named by path, the
// incoming error will describe the problem and the function can decide how
// to handle that error (and Walk will not descend into that directory). If
// an error is returned, processing stops. The sole exception is when the function
// returns the special value SkipDir. If the function returns SkipDir when invoked
// on a directory, Walk skips the directory's contents entirely.
// If the function returns SkipDir when invoked on a non-directory file,
// Walk skips the remaining files in the containing directory.

// and directories are filtered by walkFn. The files are walked in lexical
// order, which makes the output deterministic but means that for very
// large directories Walk can be inefficient.
// Walk does not follow symbolic links.

// Base returns the last element of path.
