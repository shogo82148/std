// ParseComplex converts the string s to a complex number
// with the precision specified by bitSize: 64 for complex64, or 128 for complex128.
// When bitSize=64, the result still has type complex128, but it will be
// convertible to complex64 without changing its value.
//
// The number represented by s must be of the form N, Ni, or N±Ni, where N stands
// for a floating-point number as recognized by ParseFloat, and i is the imaginary
// component. If the second N is unsigned, a + sign is required between the two components
// as indicated by the ±. If the second N is NaN, only a + sign is accepted.
// The form may be parenthesized and cannot contain any spaces.
// The resulting complex number consists of the two components converted by ParseFloat.
//
// The errors that ParseComplex returns have concrete type *NumError
// and include err.Num = s.
//
// If s is not syntactically well-formed, ParseComplex returns err.Err = ErrSyntax.
//
// If s is syntactically well-formed but either component is more than 1/2 ULP
// away from the largest floating point number of the given component's size,
// ParseComplex returns err.Err = ErrRange and c = ±Inf for the respective component.
