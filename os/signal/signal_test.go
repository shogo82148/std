package signal

// settleTime is an upper bound on how long we expect signals to take to be
// delivered. Lower values make the test faster, but also flakier â€” especially
// on heavily loaded systems.
//
// The current value is set based on flakes observed in the Go builders.

// fatalWaitingTime is an absurdly long time to wait for signals to be
// delivered but, using it, we (hopefully) eliminate test flakes on the
// build servers. See #46736 for discussion.
