// Notify causes package signal to relay incoming signals to c.
// If no signals are listed, all incoming signals will be relayed to c.
// Otherwise, just the listed signals will.
//
// Package signal will not block sending to c: the caller must ensure
// that c has sufficient buffer space to keep up with the expected
// signal rate.  For a channel used for notification of just one signal value,
// a buffer of size 1 is sufficient.
//
// It is allowed to call Notify multiple times with the same channel:
// each call expands the set of signals sent to that channel.
// The only way to remove signals from the set is to call Stop.
//
// It is allowed to call Notify multiple times with different channels
// and the same signals: each channel receives copies of incoming
// signals independently.
func Notify(c chan<- os.Signal, sig ...os.Signal)

// Stop causes package signal to stop relaying incoming signals to c.
// It undoes the effect of all prior calls to Notify using c.
// When Stop returns, it is guaranteed that c will receive no more signals.
func Stop(c chan<- os.Signal)
