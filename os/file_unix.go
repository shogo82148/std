package os

// file is the real representation of *File.
// The extra level of indirection ensures that no clients of os
// can overwrite this data, which could cause the finalizer
// to close the wrong file descriptor.

// Fd returns the integer Unix file descriptor referencing the open file.
// If f is closed, the file descriptor becomes invalid.
// If f is garbage collected, a finalizer may close the file descriptor,
// making it invalid; see runtime.SetFinalizer for more information on when
// a finalizer might be run. On Unix systems this will cause the SetDeadline
// methods to stop working.
// Because file descriptors can be reused, the returned file descriptor may
// only be closed through the Close method of f, or by its finalizer during
// garbage collection. Otherwise, during garbage collection the finalizer
// may close an unrelated file descriptor with the same (reused) number.
//
// As an alternative, see the f.SyscallConn method.
func (f *File) Fd() uintptr

// NewFile returns a new File with the given file descriptor and
// name. The returned value will be nil if fd is not a valid file
// descriptor. On Unix systems, if the file descriptor is in
// non-blocking mode, NewFile will attempt to return a pollable File
// (one for which the SetDeadline methods work).
//
// After passing it to NewFile, fd may become invalid under the same
// conditions described in the comments of the Fd method, and the same
// constraints apply.
func NewFile(fd uintptr, name string) *File

// newFileKind describes the kind of file to newFile.

// DevNull is the name of the operating system's “null device.”
// On Unix-like systems, it is "/dev/null"; on Windows, "NUL".

// Truncate changes the size of the named file.
// If the file is a symbolic link, it changes the size of the link's target.
// If there is an error, it will be of type *PathError.
func Truncate(name string, size int64) error

// Remove removes the named file or (empty) directory.
// If there is an error, it will be of type *PathError.

// Link creates newname as a hard link to the oldname file.
// If there is an error, it will be of type *LinkError.
func Link(oldname, newname string) error

// Symlink creates newname as a symbolic link to oldname.
// On Windows, a symlink to a non-existent oldname creates a file symlink;
// if oldname is later created as a directory the symlink will not work.
// If there is an error, it will be of type *LinkError.
func Symlink(oldname, newname string) error

// Readlink returns the destination of the named symbolic link.
// If there is an error, it will be of type *PathError.
