// NewFile returns a new File with the given file descriptor and
// name. The returned value will be nil if fd is not a valid file
// descriptor. On Unix systems, if the file descriptor is in
// non-blocking mode, NewFile will attempt to return a pollable File
// (one for which the SetDeadline methods work).
//
// After passing it to NewFile, fd may become invalid under the same
// conditions described in the comments of the Fd method, and the same
// constraints apply.
