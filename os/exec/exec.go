// Package exec runs external commands. It wraps os.StartProcess to make it
// easier to remap stdin and stdout, connect I/O with pipes, and do other
// adjustments.
//
// Unlike the "system" library call from C and other languages, the
// os/exec package intentionally does not invoke the system shell and
// does not expand any glob patterns or handle other expansions,
// pipelines, or redirections typically done by shells. The package
// behaves more like C's "exec" family of functions. To expand glob
// patterns, either call the shell directly, taking care to escape any
// dangerous input, or use the path/filepath package's Glob function.
// To expand environment variables, use package os's ExpandEnv.
//
// Note that the examples in this package assume a Unix system.
// They may not run on Windows, and they do not run in the Go Playground
// used by golang.org and godoc.org.
//
// # Executables in the current directory
//
// The functions Command and LookPath look for a program
// in the directories listed in the current path, following the
// conventions of the host operating system.
// Operating systems have for decades included the current
// directory in this search, sometimes implicitly and sometimes
// configured explicitly that way by default.
// Modern practice is that including the current directory
// is usually unexpected and often leads to security problems.
//
// To avoid those security problems, as of Go 1.19, this package will not resolve a program
// using an implicit or explicit path entry relative to the current directory.
// That is, if you run exec.LookPath("go"), it will not successfully return
// ./go on Unix nor .\go.exe on Windows, no matter how the path is configured.
// Instead, if the usual path algorithms would result in that answer,
// these functions return an error err satisfying errors.Is(err, ErrDot).
//
// For example, consider these two program snippets:
//
//	path, err := exec.LookPath("prog")
//	if err != nil {
//		log.Fatal(err)
//	}
//	use(path)
//
// and
//
//	cmd := exec.Command("prog")
//	if err := cmd.Run(); err != nil {
//		log.Fatal(err)
//	}
//
// These will not find and run ./prog or .\prog.exe,
// no matter how the current path is configured.
//
// Code that always wants to run a program from the current directory
// can be rewritten to say "./prog" instead of "prog".
//
// Code that insists on including results from relative path entries
// can instead override the error using an errors.Is check:
//
//	path, err := exec.LookPath("prog")
//	if errors.Is(err, exec.ErrDot) {
//		err = nil
//	}
//	if err != nil {
//		log.Fatal(err)
//	}
//	use(path)
//
// and
//
//	cmd := exec.Command("prog")
//	if errors.Is(cmd.Err, exec.ErrDot) {
//		cmd.Err = nil
//	}
//	if err := cmd.Run(); err != nil {
//		log.Fatal(err)
//	}
//
// Setting the environment variable GODEBUG=execerrdot=0
// disables generation of ErrDot entirely, temporarily restoring the pre-Go 1.19
// behavior for programs that are unable to apply more targeted fixes.
// A future version of Go may remove support for this variable.
//
// Before adding such overrides, make sure you understand the
// security implications of doing so.
// See https://go.dev/blog/path-security for more information.

// A ctxResult reports the result of watching the Context associated with a
// running command (and sending corresponding signals if needed).

// Command returns the Cmd struct to execute the named program with
// the given arguments.
//
// It sets only the Path and Args in the returned structure.
//
// If name contains no path separators, Command uses LookPath to
// resolve name to a complete path if possible. Otherwise it uses name
// directly as Path.
//
// The returned Cmd's Args field is constructed from the command name
// followed by the elements of arg, so arg should not include the
// command name itself. For example, Command("echo", "hello").
// Args[0] is always name, not the possibly resolved Path.
//
// On Windows, processes receive the whole command line as a single string
// and do their own parsing. Command combines and quotes Args into a command
// line string with an algorithm compatible with applications using
// CommandLineToArgvW (which is the most common way). Notable exceptions are
// msiexec.exe and cmd.exe (and thus, all batch files), which have a different
// unquoting algorithm. In these or other similar cases, you can do the
// quoting yourself and provide the full command line in SysProcAttr.CmdLine,
