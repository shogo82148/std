// backtrack is a regular expression search with submatch
// tracking for small regular expressions and texts. It allocates
// a bit vector with (length of input) * (length of prog) bits,
// to make sure it never explores the same (character position, instruction)
// state multiple times. This limits the search to run in time linear in
// the length of the test.
//
// backtrack is a fast replacement for the NFA code on small
// regexps when onepass cannot be used.

package regexp

// A job is an entry on the backtracker's job stack. It holds
// the instruction pc and the position in the input.

// bitState holds state for the backtracker.
