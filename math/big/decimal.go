// This file implements multi-precision decimal numbers.
// The implementation is for float to decimal conversion only;
// not general purpose use.
// The only operations are precise conversion from binary to
// decimal and rounding.
//
// The key observation and some code (shr) is borrowed from
// strconv/decimal.go: conversion of binary fractional values can be done
// precisely in multi-precision decimal because 2 divides 10 (required for
// >> of mantissa); but conversion of decimal floating-point values cannot
// be done precisely in binary representation.
//
// In contrast to strconv/decimal.go, only right shift is implemented in
// decimal format - left shift can be done precisely in binary format.

package big

// A decimal represents an unsigned floating-point number in decimal representation.
// The value of a non-zero decimal d is d.mant * 10**d.exp with 0.1 <= d.mant < 1,
// with the most-significant mantissa digit at index 0. For the zero decimal, the
// mantissa length and exponent are 0.
// The zero value for decimal represents a ready-to-use 0.0.

// Maximum shift amount that can be done in one pass without overflow.
// A Word has _W bits and (1<<maxShift - 1)*10 + 9 must fit into Word.
