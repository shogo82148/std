// ProbablyPrime reports whether x is probably prime,
// applying the Miller-Rabin test with n pseudorandomly chosen bases
// as well as a Baillie-PSW test.
//
// If x is prime, ProbablyPrime returns true.
// If x is chosen randomly and not prime, ProbablyPrime probably returns false.
// The probability of returning true for a randomly chosen non-prime is at most ¼ⁿ.
//
// ProbablyPrime is 100% accurate for inputs less than 2⁶⁴.
// See Menezes et al., Handbook of Applied Cryptography, 1997, pp. 145-149,
// and FIPS 186-4 Appendix F for further discussion of the error probabilities.
//
// ProbablyPrime is not suitable for judging primes that an adversary may
// have crafted to fool the test.
//
// As of Go 1.8, ProbablyPrime(0) is allowed and applies only a Baillie-PSW test.
// Before Go 1.8, ProbablyPrime applied only the Miller-Rabin tests, and ProbablyPrime(0) panicked.
