// An unsigned integer x of the form
//
//   x = x[n-1]*_B^(n-1) + x[n-2]*_B^(n-2) + ... + x[1]*_B + x[0]
//
// with 0 <= x[i] < _B and 0 <= i < n is stored in a slice of length n,
// with the digits x[i] as the slice elements.
//
// A number is normalized if the slice contains no leading 0 digits.
// During arithmetic operations, denormalized values may occur but are
// always normalized before returning the final result. The normalized
// representation of 0 is the empty or nil slice (length = 0).
//

// Operands that are shorter than karatsubaThreshold are multiplied using
// "grade school" multiplication; for longer operands the Karatsuba algorithm
// is used.
