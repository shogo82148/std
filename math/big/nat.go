// This file implements unsigned multi-precision integers (natural
// numbers). They are the building blocks for the implementation
// of signed integers, rationals, and floating-point numbers.
//
// Caution: This implementation relies on the function "alias"
//          which assumes that (nat) slice capacities are never
//          changed (no 3-operand slice expressions). If that
//          changes, alias needs to be updated for correctness.
