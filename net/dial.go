// Dial connects to the address on the named network.
//
// Known networks are "tcp", "tcp4" (IPv4-only), "tcp6" (IPv6-only),
// "udp", "udp4" (IPv4-only), "udp6" (IPv6-only), "ip", "ip4"
// (IPv4-only), "ip6" (IPv6-only), "unix", "unixgram" and
// "unixpacket".
//
// For TCP and UDP networks, the address has the form "host:port".
// The host must be a literal IP address, or a host name that can be
// resolved to IP addresses.
// The port must be a literal port number or a service name.
// If the host is a literal IPv6 address it must be enclosed in square
// brackets, as in "[2001:db8::1]:80" or "[fe80::1%zone]:80".
// The zone specifies the scope of the literal IPv6 address as defined
// in RFC 4007.
// The functions JoinHostPort and SplitHostPort manipulate a pair of
// host and port in this form.
// When using TCP, and the host resolves to multiple IP addresses,
// Dial will try each IP address in order until one succeeds.
//
// Examples:
//
//	Dial("tcp", "golang.org:http")
//	Dial("tcp", "192.0.2.1:http")
//	Dial("tcp", "198.51.100.1:80")
//	Dial("udp", "[2001:db8::1]:domain")
//	Dial("udp", "[fe80::1%lo0]:53")
//	Dial("tcp", ":80")
//
// For IP networks, the network must be "ip", "ip4" or "ip6" followed
// by a colon and a literal protocol number or a protocol name, and
// the address has the form "host". The host must be a literal IP
// address or a literal IPv6 address with zone.
// It depends on each operating system how the operating system
// behaves with a non-well known protocol number such as "0" or "255".
//
// Examples:
//
//	Dial("ip4:1", "192.0.2.1")
//	Dial("ip6:ipv6-icmp", "2001:db8::1")
//	Dial("ip6:58", "fe80::1%lo0")
//
// For TCP, UDP and IP networks, if the host is empty or a literal
// unspecified IP address, as in ":80", "0.0.0.0:80" or "[::]:80" for
// TCP and UDP, "", "0.0.0.0" or "::" for IP, the local system is
// assumed.
//
// For Unix networks, the address must be a file system path.

// to connect.

//
// When using TCP, and the host in the address parameter resolves to multiple
// network addresses, any dial timeout (from d.Timeout or ctx) is spread
// over each consecutive dial, such that each is given an appropriate

// For example, if a host has 4 IP addresses and the timeout is 1 minute,

// before trying the next one.
