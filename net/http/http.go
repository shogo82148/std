	// URL that contains a valid host and the same scheme as the parent request.
	// If the target is a path, it will inherit the scheme and host of the
	// parent request.

	// Push may or may not detect these invalid pushes; however, invalid
	// pushes will be detected and canceled by conforming clients.
	//
	// Handlers that wish to push URL X should call Push before sending any
	// data that may trigger a request for URL X. This avoids a race where the
	// client issues requests for X before receiving the PUSH_PROMISE for X.
	//
	// Push will run in a separate goroutine making the order of arrival
	// non-deterministic. Any required synchronization needs to be implemented
	// by the caller.

	// Push returns ErrNotSupported if the client has disabled push or if push
	// is not supported on the underlying connection.
