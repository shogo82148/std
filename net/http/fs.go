// ServeContent replies to the request using the content in the
// provided ReadSeeker. The main benefit of ServeContent over io.Copy
// is that it handles Range requests properly, sets the MIME type, and
// handles If-Modified-Since requests.
//
// If the response's Content-Type header is not set, ServeContent
// first tries to deduce the type from name's file extension and,
// if that fails, falls back to reading the first block of the content
// and passing it to DetectContentType.
// The name is otherwise unused; in particular it can be empty and is
// never sent in the response.
//
// If modtime is not the zero time or Unix epoch, ServeContent
// includes it in a Last-Modified header in the response. If the
// request includes an If-Modified-Since header, ServeContent uses
// modtime to decide whether the content needs to be sent at all.
//
// The content's Seek method must work: ServeContent uses
// a seek to the end of the content to determine its size.
//
// If the caller has set w's ETag header, ServeContent uses it to
// handle requests using If-Range and If-None-Match.
//
// Note that *os.File implements the io.ReadSeeker interface.

// included in the sizeFunc reply so it's not sent over HTTP to end
// users.

// ServeFile replies to the request with the contents of the named
// file or directory.
//
// If the provided file or directory name is a relative path, it is
// interpreted relative to the current directory and may ascend to parent
// directories. If the provided name is constructed from user input, it
// should be sanitized before calling ServeFile. As a precaution, ServeFile
// will reject requests where r.URL.Path contains a ".." path element.
//
// As a special case, ServeFile redirects any request where r.URL.Path
// ends in "/index.html" to the same path, without the final
// "index.html". To avoid such redirects either modify the path or
// use ServeContent.

// FileServer returns a handler that serves HTTP requests
// with the contents of the file system rooted at root.
//
// To use the operating system's file system implementation,
// use http.Dir:
//
//	http.Handle("/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("/tmp")))
//
// As a special case, the returned file server redirects any request
// ending in "/index.html" to the same path, without the final
// "index.html".
