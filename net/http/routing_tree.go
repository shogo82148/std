// This file implements a decision tree for fast matching of requests to
// patterns.
//
// The root of the tree branches on the host of the request.
// The next level branches on the method.
// The remaining levels branch on consecutive segments of the path.
//
// The "more specific wins" precedence rule can result in backtracking.
// For example, given the patterns
//     /a/b/z
//     /a/{x}/c
// we will first try to match the path "/a/b/c" with /a/b/z, and
// when that fails we will try against /a/{x}/c.
