// Response represents the response from an HTTP request.
//
// The [Client] and [Transport] return Responses from servers once
// the response headers have been received. The response body
// is streamed on demand as the Body field is read.
type Response struct {
	Status     string
	StatusCode int
	Proto      string
	ProtoMajor int
	ProtoMinor int

	// Header maps header keys to values. If the response had multiple
	// headers with the same key, they may be concatenated, with comma
	// delimiters.  (RFC 7230, section 3.2.2 requires that multiple headers
	// be semantically equivalent to a comma-delimited sequence.) When
	// Header values are duplicated by other fields in this struct (e.g.,
	// ContentLength, TransferEncoding, Trailer), the field values are
	// authoritative.
	//
	// Keys in the map are canonicalized (see CanonicalHeaderKey).
	Header Header

	// Body represents the response body.
	//
	// The response body is streamed on demand as the Body field
	// is read. If the network connection fails or the server
	// terminates the response, Body.Read calls return an error.
	//
	// The http Client and Transport guarantee that Body is always
	// non-nil, even on responses without a body or responses with
	// a zero-length body. It is the caller's responsibility to
	// close Body. The default HTTP client's Transport may not
	// reuse HTTP/1.x "keep-alive" TCP connections if the Body is
	// not read to completion and closed.
	//
	// The Body is automatically dechunked if the server replied
	// with a "chunked" Transfer-Encoding.
	//
	// As of Go 1.12, the Body will also implement io.Writer
	// on a successful "101 Switching Protocols" response,
	// as used by WebSockets and HTTP/2's "h2c" mode.
	Body io.ReadCloser

	// ContentLength records the length of the associated content. The
	// value -1 indicates that the length is unknown. Unless Request.Method
	// is "HEAD", values >= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may
	// be read from Body.
	ContentLength int64

	// Contains transfer encodings from outer-most to inner-most. Value is
	// nil, means that "identity" encoding is used.
	TransferEncoding []string

	// Close records whether the header directed that the connection be
	// closed after reading Body. The value is advice for clients: neither
	// ReadResponse nor Response.Write ever closes a connection.
	Close bool

	// Uncompressed reports whether the response was sent compressed but
	// was decompressed by the http package. When true, reading from
	// Body yields the uncompressed content instead of the compressed
	// content actually set from the server, ContentLength is set to -1,
	// and the "Content-Length" and "Content-Encoding" fields are deleted
	// from the responseHeader. To get the original response from
	// the server, set Transport.DisableCompression to true.
	Uncompressed bool

	// Trailer maps trailer keys to values in the same
	// format as Header.
	//
	// The Trailer initially contains only nil values, one for
	// each key specified in the server's "Trailer" header
	// value. Those values are not added to Header.
	//
	// Trailer must not be accessed concurrently with Read calls
	// on the Body.
	//
	// After Body.Read has returned io.EOF, Trailer will contain
	// any trailer values sent by the server.
	Trailer Header

	// Request is the request that was sent to obtain this Response.
	// Request's Body is nil (having already been consumed).
	// This is only populated for Client requests.
	Request *Request

	// TLS contains information about the TLS connection on which the
	// response was received. It is nil for unencrypted responses.
	// The pointer is shared between responses and should not be
	// modified.
	TLS *tls.ConnectionState

// The req parameter optionally specifies the [Request] that corresponds

// After that call, clients can inspect resp.Trailer to find key/value
// pairs included in the response trailer.

//	ProtoMinor
//	Request.Method
//	TransferEncoding
