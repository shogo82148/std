// A Client is an HTTP client. Its zero value (DefaultClient) is a

// The Client's Transport typically has internal state (cached TCP
// connections), so Clients should be reused instead of created as
// needed. Clients are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
//
// A Client is higher-level than a RoundTripper (such as Transport)
// and additionally handles HTTP details such as cookies and
// redirects.

// (typically Transport) may not be able to re-use a persistent TCP
// connection to the server for a subsequent "keep-alive" request.
//
// The request Body, if non-nil, will be closed by the underlying
// Transport, even on errors.

// Generally Get, Post, or PostForm will be used instead of Do.
