// NewChunkedReader is not needed by normal applications. The http package

// NewChunkedWriter returns a new chunkedWriter that translates writes into HTTP
// "chunked" format before writing them to w. Closing the returned chunkedWriter
// sends the final 0-length chunk that marks the end of the stream.
//
// NewChunkedWriter is not needed by normal applications. The http
// package adds chunking automatically if handlers don't set a
// Content-Length header. Using NewChunkedWriter inside a handler
// would result in double chunking or chunking with a Content-Length
// length, both of which are wrong.

// Writing to chunkedWriter translates to writing in HTTP chunked Transfer
// Encoding wire format to the underlying Wire chunkedWriter.
