// Transport is an implementation of RoundTripper that supports HTTP,
// HTTPS, and HTTP proxies (for either HTTP or HTTPS with CONNECT).
//
// By default, Transport caches connections for future re-use.
// This may leave many open connections when accessing many hosts.
// This behavior can be managed using Transport's CloseIdleConnections method
// and the MaxIdleConnsPerHost and DisableKeepAlives fields.
//
// Transports should be reused instead of created as needed.
// Transports are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
//
// A Transport is a low-level primitive for making HTTP and HTTPS requests.
// For high-level functionality, such as cookies and redirects, see Client.
//
// Transport uses HTTP/1.1 for HTTP URLs and either HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2
// for HTTPS URLs, depending on whether the server supports HTTP/2,
// and how the Transport is configured. The DefaultTransport supports HTTP/2.
// To explicitly enable HTTP/2 on a transport, use golang.org/x/net/http2
// and call ConfigureTransport. See the package docs for more about HTTP/2.
//
// The Transport will send CONNECT requests to a proxy for its own use
// when processing HTTPS requests, but Transport should generally not
// be used to send a CONNECT request. That is, the Request passed to
// the RoundTrip method should not have a Method of "CONNECT", as Go's
// HTTP/1.x implementation does not support full-duplex request bodies
// being written while the response body is streamed. Go's HTTP/2
// implementation does support full duplex, but many CONNECT proxies speak
// HTTP/1.x.

// ProxyFromEnvironment returns the URL of the proxy to use for a

// envOnce looks up an environment variable (optionally by multiple

// error values for debugging and testing, not seen by users.

// transportReadFromServerError is used by Transport.readLoop when the
// 1 byte peek read fails and we're actually anticipating a response.
// Usually this is just due to the inherent keep-alive shut down race,
// where the server closed the connection at the same time the client
// wrote. The underlying err field is usually io.EOF or some
// ECONNRESET sort of thing which varies by platform. But it might be
// the user's custom net.Conn.Read error too, so we carry it along for
// them to return from Transport.RoundTrip.

// persistConnWriter is the io.Writer written to by pc.bw.
// It accumulates the number of bytes written to the underlying conn,
// so the retry logic can determine whether any bytes made it across
// the wire.
// This is exactly 1 pointer field wide so it can go into an interface
// without allocation.

// connectMethod is the map key (in its String form) for keeping persistent
// TCP connections alive for subsequent HTTP requests.
//
// A connect method may be of the following types:
//
//	Cache key form                    Description
//	-----------------                 -------------------------
//	|http|foo.com                     http directly to server, no proxy
//	|https|foo.com                    https directly to server, no proxy
//	http://proxy.com|https|foo.com    http to proxy, then CONNECT to foo.com
//	http://proxy.com|http             http to proxy, http to anywhere after that
//	socks5://proxy.com|http|foo.com   socks5 to proxy, then http to foo.com
//	socks5://proxy.com|https|foo.com  socks5 to proxy, then https to foo.com
//	https://proxy.com|https|foo.com   https to proxy, then CONNECT to foo.com
//	https://proxy.com|http            https to proxy, http to anywhere after that
//

// connectMethodKey is the map key version of connectMethod, with a
// stringified proxy URL (or the empty string) instead of a pointer to
// a URL.

// persistConn wraps a connection, usually a persistent one
// (but may be used for non-keep-alive requests as well)

// nothingWrittenError wraps a write errors which ended up writing zero bytes.

// responseAndError is how the goroutine reading from an HTTP/1 server
// communicates with the goroutine doing the RoundTrip.

// A writeRequest is sent by the readLoop's goroutine to the
// writeLoop's goroutine to write a request while the read loop
// concurrently waits on both the write response and the server's
// reply.

// testHooks. Always non-nil.

// tLogKey is a context WithValue key for test debugging contexts containing
// a t.Logf func. See export_test.go's Request.WithT method.

// bodyEOFSignal is used by the HTTP/1 transport when reading response
// bodies to make sure we see the end of a response body before
// proceeding and reading on the connection again.
//
// It wraps a ReadCloser but runs fn (if non-nil) at most
// once, right before its final (error-producing) Read or Close call
// returns. fn should return the new error to return from Read or Close.
//
// If earlyCloseFn is non-nil and Close is called before io.EOF is
// seen, earlyCloseFn is called instead of fn, and its return value is
// the return value from Close.

// gzipReader wraps a response body so it can lazily
// call gzip.NewReader on the first call to Read

// fakeLocker is a sync.Locker which does nothing. It's used to guard
// test-only fields when not under test, to avoid runtime atomic
// overhead.
