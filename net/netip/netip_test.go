// ip4i was one of the possible representations of IP that came up in
// discussions, inlining IPv4 addresses, but having an "overflow"
// interface for IPv6 or IPv6 + zone. This is here for benchmarking.

// Sink variables are here to force the compiler to not elide
// seemingly useless work in benchmarks and allocation tests. If you
// were to just `_ = foo()` within a test function, the compiler could
// correctly deduce that foo() does nothing and doesn't need to be
// called. By writing results to a global variable, we hide that fact
// from the compiler and force it to keep the code under test.
