// except when multiple Reads are needed to consume a single Write.
// That is, each Write to the PipeWriter blocks until it has satisfied
// one or more Reads from the PipeReader that fully consume
// the written data.
// The data is copied directly from the Write to the corresponding
// Read (or Reads); there is no internal buffering.
//
// It is safe to call Read and Write in parallel with each other or with Close.
// Parallel calls to Read and parallel calls to Write are also safe:
// the individual calls will be gated sequentially.
