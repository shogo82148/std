// MultiReader returns a Reader that's the logical concatenation of
// the provided input readers. They're read sequentially. Once all
// inputs have returned EOF, Read will return EOF.  If any of the readers
// return a non-nil, non-EOF error, Read will return that error.

// MultiWriter creates a writer that duplicates its writes to all the
// provided writers, similar to the Unix tee(1) command.
//
// Each write is written to each listed writer, one at a time.
// If a listed writer returns an error, that overall write operation
// stops and returns the error; it does not continue down the list.
