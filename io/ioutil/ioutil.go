// ReadAll reads from r until an error or EOF and returns the data it read.
// A successful call returns err == nil, not err == EOF. Because ReadAll is

// as an error to be reported.
//
// As of Go 1.16, this function simply calls io.ReadAll.
func ReadAll(r io.Reader) ([]byte, error)

// ReadFile reads the file named by filename and returns the contents.
// A successful call returns err == nil, not err == EOF. Because ReadFile
// reads the whole file, it does not treat an EOF from Read as an error
// to be reported.
//
// As of Go 1.16, this function simply calls os.ReadFile.

// WriteFile writes data to a file named by filename.
// If the file does not exist, WriteFile creates it with permissions perm
// (before umask); otherwise WriteFile truncates it before writing, without changing permissions.
//
// As of Go 1.16, this function simply calls os.WriteFile.

// ReadDir reads the directory named by dirname and returns
// a list of fs.FileInfo for the directory's contents,
// sorted by filename. If an error occurs reading the directory,
// ReadDir returns no directory entries along with the error.
//
// As of Go 1.16, os.ReadDir is a more efficient and correct choice:
// it returns a list of fs.DirEntry instead of fs.FileInfo,
// and it returns partial results in the case of an error
// midway through reading a directory.
func ReadDir(dirname string) ([]fs.FileInfo, error)

// NopCloser returns a ReadCloser with a no-op Close method wrapping
// the provided Reader r.
//
// As of Go 1.16, this function simply calls io.NopCloser.

// Discard is an io.Writer on which all Write calls succeed
// without doing anything.
//
// As of Go 1.16, this value is simply io.Discard.
