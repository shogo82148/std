// Calling ast.MergePackageFiles with ast.FilterFuncDuplicates
// keeps a duplicate entry with attached documentation in favor
// of one without, and it favors duplicate entries appearing
// later in the source over ones appearing earlier. This is why
// (*t2).f2 is kept and t2.f2 is eliminated in this test case.
