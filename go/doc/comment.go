// ToHTML converts comment text to formatted HTML.
// The comment was prepared by DocReader,
// so it is known not to have leading, trailing blank lines
// nor to have trailing spaces at the end of lines.
// The comment markers have already been removed.
//
// Each span of unindented non-blank lines is converted into
// a single paragraph. There is one exception to the rule: a span that
// consists of a single line, is followed by another paragraph span,
// begins with a capital letter, and contains no punctuation
// other than parentheses and commas is formatted as a heading.
//
// A span of indented lines is converted into a <pre> block,
// with the common indent prefix removed.
//
// URLs in the comment text are converted into links; if the URL also appears
// in the words map, the link is taken from the map (if the corresponding map
// value is the empty string, the URL is not converted into a link).
//
// Go identifiers that appear in the words map are italicized; if the corresponding
// map value is not the empty string, it is considered a URL and the word is converted
// into a link.

// ToText prepares comment text for presentation in textual output.
// It wraps paragraphs of text to width or fewer Unicode code points
// and then prefixes each line with the indent. In preformatted sections
// (such as program text), it prefixes each non-blank line with preIndent.
