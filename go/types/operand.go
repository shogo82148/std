// An operandMode specifies the (addressing) mode of an operand.

// An operand represents an intermediate value during type checking.
// Operands have an (addressing) mode, the expression evaluating to
// the operand, the operand's type, a value for constants, and an id
// for built-in functions.
// The zero value of operand is a ready to use invalid operand.
