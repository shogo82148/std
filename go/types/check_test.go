// This file implements a typechecker test harness. The packages specified
// in tests are typechecked. Error messages reported by the typechecker are
// compared against the errors expected in the test files.
//
// Expected errors are indicated in the test files by putting comments
// of the form /* ERROR pattern */ or /* ERRORx pattern */ (or a similar
// //-style line comment) immediately following the tokens where errors
// are reported. There must be exactly one blank before and after the
// ERROR/ERRORx indicator, and the pattern must be a properly quoted Go
// string.
//
// The harness will verify that each ERROR pattern is a substring of the
// error reported at that source position, and that each ERRORx pattern
// is a regular expression matching the respective error.
// Consecutive comments may be used to indicate multiple errors reported
// at the same position.
//
// For instance, the following test source indicates that an "undeclared"
// error should be reported for the undeclared variable x:
//
//	package p
//	func f() {
//		_ = x /* ERROR "undeclared" */ + 1
//	}
