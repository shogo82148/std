// It is ok to re-use the same file when re-scanning the same file as
// line information which is already present is ignored. Init causes a
// panic if the file size does not match the src size.
//
// Calls to Scan will invoke the error handler err if they encounter a
// syntax error and err is not nil. Also, for each error encountered,
// the Scanner field ErrorCount is incremented by one. The mode parameter
// determines how comments are handled.

// of the file.

// Scan scans the next token and returns the token position, the token,
// and its literal string if applicable. The source end is indicated by
// token.EOF.
//
// If the returned token is a literal (token.IDENT, token.INT, token.FLOAT,
// token.IMAG, token.CHAR, token.STRING) or token.COMMENT, the literal string
// has the corresponding value.
//
// If the returned token is a keyword, the literal string is the keyword.
//
// If the returned token is token.SEMICOLON, the corresponding
// literal string is ";" if the semicolon was present in the source,
// and "\n" if the semicolon was inserted because of a newline or
// at EOF.
//
// If the returned token is token.ILLEGAL, the literal string is the
// offending character.
//
// In all other cases, Scan returns an empty literal string.
//
// For more tolerant parsing, Scan will return a valid token if
// possible even if a syntax error was encountered. Thus, even
// if the resulting token sequence contains no illegal tokens,
// a client may not assume that no error occurred. Instead it
// must check the scanner's ErrorCount or the number of calls
// of the error handler, if there was one installed.
//
// Scan adds line information to the file added to the file
// set with Init. Token positions are relative to that file
// and thus relative to the file set.
