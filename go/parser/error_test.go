// This file implements a parser test harness. The files in the testdata
// directory are parsed and the errors reported are compared against the
// error messages expected in the test files. The test files must end in
// .src rather than .go so that they are not disturbed by gofmt runs.
//
// Expected errors are indicated in the test files by putting a comment
// of the form /* ERROR "rx" */ immediately following an offending token.
// The harness will verify that an error matching the regular expression
// rx is reported at that source position.
//
// For instance, the following test file indicates that a "not declared"
// error should be reported for the undeclared variable x:
//
//	package p
//	func f() {
//		_ = x /* ERROR "not declared" */ + 1
//	}
