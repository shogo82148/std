// Package heap provides heap operations for any type that implements
// heap.Interface. A heap is a tree with the property that each node is the
// minimum-valued node in its subtree.
//
// The minimum element in the tree is the root, at index 0.
//
// A heap is a common way to implement a priority queue. To build a priority
// queue, implement the Heap interface with the (negative) priority as the
// ordering for the Less method, so Push adds items while Pop removes the
// highest-priority item from the queue. The Examples include such an
// implementation; the file example_pq_test.go has the complete source.

// The Interface type describes the requirements
// for a type using the routines in this package.
// Any type that implements it may be used as a
// min-heap with the following invariants (established after
// Init has been called or if the data is empty or sorted):
//
//	!h.Less(j, i) for 0 <= i < h.Len() and 2*i+1 <= j <= 2*i+2 and j < h.Len()
//
// Note that Push and Pop in this interface are for package heap's
// implementation to call. To add and remove things from the heap,
// use heap.Push and heap.Pop.
type Interface interface {
	sort.Interface
	Push(x interface{})
	Pop() interface{}
}

// Init establishes the heap invariants required by the other routines in this package.
// Init is idempotent with respect to the heap invariants
// and may be called whenever the heap invariants may have been invalidated.
// The complexity is O(n) where n = h.Len().
func Init(h Interface)

// Push pushes the element x onto the heap.
// The complexity is O(log n) where n = h.Len().
func Push(h Interface, x interface{})

// Pop removes and returns the minimum element (according to Less) from the heap.
// The complexity is O(log n) where n = h.Len().
// Pop is equivalent to Remove(h, 0).
func Pop(h Interface) interface{}

// Remove removes and returns the element at index i from the heap.
// The complexity is O(log n) where n = h.Len().
func Remove(h Interface, i int) interface{}

// Fix re-establishes the heap ordering after the element at index i has changed its value.
// Changing the value of the element at index i and then calling Fix is equivalent to,
// but less expensive than, calling Remove(h, i) followed by a Push of the new value.
// The complexity is O(log n) where n = h.Len().
func Fix(h Interface, i int)
