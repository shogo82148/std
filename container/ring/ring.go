// Package ring implements operations on circular lists.
package ring

// A Ring is an element of a circular list, or ring.
// Rings do not have a beginning or end; a pointer to any ring element
// serves as reference to the entire ring. Empty rings are represented
// as nil Ring pointers. The zero value for a Ring is a one-element
// ring with a nil Value.
type Ring struct {
	next, prev *Ring
	Value      interface{}
}

// Next returns the next ring element. r must not be empty.
func (r *Ring) Next() *Ring

// Prev returns the previous ring element. r must not be empty.
func (r *Ring) Prev() *Ring

// Move moves n % r.Len() elements backward (n < 0) or forward (n >= 0)
// in the ring and returns that ring element. r must not be empty.
func (r *Ring) Move(n int) *Ring

// New creates a ring of n elements.
func New(n int) *Ring

// Link connects ring r with ring s such that r.Next()
// becomes s and returns the original value for r.Next().
// r must not be empty.
//
// If r and s point to the same ring, linking
// them removes the elements between r and s from the ring.
// The removed elements form a subring and the result is a
// reference to that subring (if no elements were removed,
// the result is still the original value for r.Next(),
// and not nil).
//
// If r and s point to different rings, linking
// them creates a single ring with the elements of s inserted
// after r. The result points to the element following the
// last element of s after insertion.
func (r *Ring) Link(s *Ring) *Ring

// Unlink removes n % r.Len() elements from the ring r, starting
// at r.Next(). If n % r.Len() == 0, r remains unchanged.
// The result is the removed subring. r must not be empty.
func (r *Ring) Unlink(n int) *Ring

// Len computes the number of elements in ring r.
// It executes in time proportional to the number of elements.
func (r *Ring) Len() int

// Do calls function f on each element of the ring, in forward order.
// The behavior of Do is undefined if f changes *r.
func (r *Ring) Do(f func(interface{}))
