// ccChecker wraps the driver.ColumnConverter and allows it to be used
// as if it were a NamedValueChecker. If the driver ColumnConverter
// is not present then the NamedValueChecker will return driver.ErrSkip.

// decimal composes or decomposes a decimal value to and from individual parts.
// There are four parts: a boolean negative flag, a form byte with three possible states
// (finite=0, infinite=1, NaN=2), a base-2 big-endian integer
// coefficient (also known as a significand) as a []byte, and an int32 exponent.
// These are composed into a final value as "decimal = (neg) (form=finite) coefficient * 10 ^ exponent".
// A zero length coefficient is a zero value.
// The big-endian integer coefficient stores the most significant byte first (at coefficient[0]).
// If the form is not finite the coefficient and exponent should be ignored.
// The negative parameter may be set to true for any form, although implementations are not required
// to respect the negative parameter in the non-finite form.
//
// Implementations may choose to set the negative parameter to true on a zero or NaN value,
// but implementations that do not differentiate between negative and positive
// zero or NaN values should ignore the negative parameter without error.
// If an implementation does not support Infinity it may be converted into a NaN without error.
// If a value is set that is larger than what is supported by an implementation,
// an error must be returned.
// Implementations must return an error if a NaN or Infinity is attempted to be set while neither
// are supported.
