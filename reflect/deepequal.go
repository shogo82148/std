// Deep equality test via reflection

package reflect

// During deepValueEqual, must keep track of checks that are
// in progress. The comparison algorithm assumes that all
// checks in progress are true when it reencounters them.
// Visited comparisons are stored in a map indexed by visit.

// DeepEqual reports whether x and y are “deeply equal,” defined as follows.
// Two values of identical type are deeply equal if one of the following cases applies.
// Values of distinct types are never deeply equal.
//
// Array values are deeply equal when their corresponding elements are deeply equal.
//
// Struct values are deeply equal if their corresponding fields,
// both exported and unexported, are deeply equal.
//
// Func values are deeply equal if both are nil; otherwise they are not deeply equal.
//
// Interface values are deeply equal if they hold deeply equal concrete values.
//
// Map values are deeply equal if they are the same map object
// or if they have the same length and their corresponding keys
// (matched using Go equality) map to deeply equal values.
//
// Pointer values are deeply equal if they are equal using Go's == operator
// or if they point to deeply equal values.
//
// Slice values are deeply equal when all of the following are true:
// they are both nil or both non-nil, they have the same length,
// and either they point to the same initial entry of the same underlying array
// (that is, &x[0] == &y[0]) or their corresponding elements (up to length) are deeply equal.
// Note that a non-nil empty slice and a nil slice (for example, []byte{} and []byte(nil))
// are not deeply equal.
//
// Other values - numbers, bools, strings, and channels - are deeply equal
// if they are equal using Go's == operator.
//
// In general DeepEqual is a recursive relaxation of Go's == operator.
// However, this idea is impossible to implement without some inconsistency.
// Specifically, it is possible for a value to be unequal to itself,
// either because it is of func type (uncomparable in general)
// or because it is a floating-point NaN value (not equal to itself in floating-point comparison),
// or because it is an array, struct, or interface containing
// such a value.
// On the other hand, pointer values are always equal to themselves,
// even if they point at or contain such problematic values,
// because they compare equal using Go's == operator, and that
// is a sufficient condition to be deeply equal, regardless of content.
// DeepEqual has been defined so that the same short-cut applies
// to slices and maps: if x and y are the same slice or the same map,
// they are deeply equal regardless of content.
