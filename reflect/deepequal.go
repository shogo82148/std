// Deep equality test via reflection

package reflect

// During deepValueEqual, must keep track of checks that are
// in progress.  The comparison algorithm assumes that all
// checks in progress are true when it reencounters them.
// Visited comparisons are stored in a map indexed by visit.

// DeepEqual tests for deep equality. It uses normal == equality where
// possible but will scan elements of arrays, slices, maps, and fields of
// structs. In maps, keys are compared with == but elements use deep
// equality. DeepEqual correctly handles recursive types. Functions are equal
// only if they are both nil.
// An empty slice is not equal to a nil slice.
func DeepEqual(a1, a2 interface{}) bool
